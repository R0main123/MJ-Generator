Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
This ain't no good for me
This ain't no good for me, babe
Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
Ain't no good for me, babe
Tell me what is going down, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I want to say it
It is just too much for me
I don't ever want to say it
'Cause it's all blasphemy
Everybody is doing it to somebody's love
In sight of me
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

[Chorus]
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (Oh yeah)
I caught your mom she doing a dude
You can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you (oh Lord)
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey Business going down


[Verse 2]
Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
Don't be calling out "Mercy me"
Don't be calling down babe
Said lord have mercy
Even worse the birthday
Don't be calling out "Mercy me"
Don't be going down babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time I wanna say it
It is just too much for me
Everybody's doing it to somebody's love
It seems to me
I just can't believe the things I'm seeing
So just let it be
I might tell on you
So don't you start no stuff with me

[Chorus]
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh lord) (doggone)
I caught your mom she doing a dude
You can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you (oh lord)
Stop it
It is too much
Monkey business going down


[Bridge]
I read the paper
And I can't believe what's going 'round
Somebody is doing it to
Somebody is up, somebody is down
The government won't pay my taxes
And I'm really mad
My mouth might let it be
So don't you monkey shine with me

[Chorus]
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh lord) (Hoo) (Hoo-hoo)
I caught your mother she doing a dude
You can't like it that we're looking right at you
(You are dirty, you are dirty, dirty, dirty baby)
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (Hee-hee) (Hoo-hoo)
Your brother didn't make it out the two times two
You sitting 'round here telling how he did it to you
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business going down

[Outro]
(Going down, babe)
Monkey business going down
(You are not satisfied baby)
Monkey business going down
(You want to party)
Monkey business going down
(My business, is your business)
Monkey business going down
(I caught your mother she doing a dude
She can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you, oh Lord)
Monkey business going down
(And monkey see, monkey do
You can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you, oh Lord)
Monkey business going down
Your business is my business
Your business is my business
Your business is my business
Monkey business going down
Your business is my business
Your business is my business
Your business
Too much for the kids, baby
It's a monkey business going down
(Oh, babe... Doggone...)
