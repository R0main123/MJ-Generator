She dances in the sheets at night
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

[Chorus]
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love

[Verse 2]
She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be out her mind


[Chorus]
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love (Oh)
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love

[Bridge]
She works so hard just to make a way
For a man to just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still, she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

[Verse 3]
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance, she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed the pride
She knew she was needed back home, home


[Chorus]
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
A rhythm of love, a rhythm of love (Love, love, love)
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of

[Outro]
You got to have pride (A rhythm of love)
To give it, want it, do it, baby (A rhythm of love)
