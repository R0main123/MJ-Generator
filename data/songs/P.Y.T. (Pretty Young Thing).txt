You know you, you make me feel so good inside
I've always wanted a girl just like you
Such a P.Y.T., pretty young thing, ooh

[Verse 1]
Where did you come from, lady?
And ooh, won't you take me there?
Right away, won't you, baby?
Tenderoni, you've got to be
Spark my nature, sugar, fly with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know now is the perfect time?
We can make it right, hit the city lights
Then tonight, ease the lovin' pain
Let me take you to the max

[Chorus]
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there, girl, ooh-oh
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
(Anywhere you wanna go)
Yes, I will, ooh


[Verse 2]
Nothin' can stop this burnin' desire to be with you
Gotta get to you, baby
Won't you come? It's emergency
Cool my fire yearnin'
Honey, come set me free

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know now is the perfect time?
We can dim the lights just to make it right
In the night, hit the lovin' spot
I'll give you all that I've got

[Chorus]
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there, yes, I will, yes, I
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there
Yes, I will, hee-eeh


[Bridge]
Pretty young thing, uh!
You make me sing, ha, ha, ha
Pretty young thing, uh!
You make me sing, ha, ha, ha
Pretty young things, repeat after me
Sing, "Na, na, na" (Na, na, na)
"Na, na-na, na" (Na, na-na, na)
Sing, "Na, na, na" (Na, na, na)
"Na-na, na-na, na" (Na-na, na-na, na)
I will take you there, take you there

[Chorus]
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there, take you there, take you there
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender lovin' care
And I'll take you there, take you there, hoo-ooh

[Outro]
Hoo-ooh! (I want to love you, P.Y.T., P.Y.T.)
Oh, baby (I want to give you T.L.C., T.L.C)
Oh, baby
Oh, darling, ooh
Girl, I can think you're really nice
I want to love you, P.Y.T., P.Y.T
You know I can, you know just get together
I want to give you T.L.C., T.L.C
You're such a P.Y.T. to me, pretty young thing
Oh, baby, oh, baby, oh, darling
I want to love you, P.Y.T., P.Y.T. (Oh, baby)
I want to give you T.L.C., T.L.C (You can be, ooh)
I just wanna love you, you know?
Ha-ha-ha, I'll give you all that I got
