She's got the look, she's so fine
And you know damn well the girl will be mine
She's got the breaks, she's the scene
And you know damn well she gives it to me
Uh-huh!
Black jeans and a turtleneck sweater
I know the girl is fakin' 'cause
I've seen her look better
She's composition, she's statistical fact
Got it ready for the willing
Got it kicking in the back

[Chorus]
(She's got the look) She's got the look, I
Want to know better
(She's got the look) She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look, I
Want to know better
(She's got the look) She's got the look
She's driving me wild

[Verse 2]
Come to the place, shocktacy
And you know damn well you know what I mean
Hot in the face, one to three
Like a pleasure trip like you've never seen
Uh-huh!
Satin lace and a paisley cut top
The girl is wasting over
'Cause she knows she looks hot
She's got position, she's got just what it takes
Got a mojo in her pocket
Got it ready just in case


[Chorus]
(She's got the look) She's got the look, I
Want to know better
(She's got the look) She's got the look
She's driving me wild
(That look, my baby) She's got the look, I
Want to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

[Rap: Aqil Davidson and Michael]
Please, no, keep back, I can't take it
You're drivin' me wild, I might not make it
Uh-huh!
You got me lookin' like buckwheat, oh
Hair pulled every which way but me
(Uh-huh!)
Far from Medusa, but your looks are deadly
You're walkin' soft, still, I hear the medley
(Uh-huh!)
Uh, shiver my timberland boots, cramped my style
She drives me wild (Hoo!)

[Chorus]
She's got the look (Hoo!)
She's got the look
(She's got the look) She's got the look, I
I want to know better
(She's got the look) She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look, I
Want to know better
She's got the look
And she's driving me wild
She's got the look, I
Want to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look, I
Want to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look, I
Want to know better
She's got the look
And she's driving me wild
