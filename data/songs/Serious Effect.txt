You got to get back every rhyme
Going to jump back
She won't get it
I got a feeling but giving you, I
And I'm so damn, so damn glad about it
I got a feeling
That your jumping around
Going to get back
She won’t get it
I got a feeling, like jumping around
And I'm so damn, so damn glad about it

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious
And I'm so damn glad about it

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
I got to feeling of giving you, I
Won't jump back
She won’t let it
I got a feeling
Like nothing around
And I'm so damn, so damn glad about it
She don't smoke, she don't do weed
She don't hash, she don't dope
But she's a liar
I got a feeling like nothing around
And I'm so damn, so damn glad about it


[Chorus]
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby
Serious
And I'm so damn glad about it

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
She's serious
Makin' me delirious, I'm curious
Next thing I know what was hitting us
Enjoying the animal magnetism
She's too hot to touch, too cool for criticism
Each and every things like a mini movie being filmed
'Cause I'm the captain and our body's the helm
I'm shivering, quivering
I smile while I'm delivering
Get some love and passion
It's never been so intense and spiritual like
In sense of above, against and all off in silence
Then I scream like a man out of his wits
'Cause that's how serious her serious effect is


[Chorus]
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby
Serious
And I'm so damn glad about it

[Interlude]
Ho!
She mentioned that I was
She mentioned that I was
(Serious)
Jumping around
I got to break down
(Serious)
She's the one who get it
(Serious)
I got a feeling
Like jumping around
(Serious)
Cause I'm so glad
And I'm so damn glad about it


[Chorus]
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect on me, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby
Serious effect on
Serious effect, baby
Serious
And I'm so damn glad about it
Serious
Serious on me
Serious
Serious on me
Serious
Serious on me
Serious
Serious on me
Serious
Serious on me
