38 ContributorsDo You Know Where Your Children Are Lyrics[Intro]
Hee, hee
Hee, hee, hee
Hee, hee, hee
Hee, hee, oh

[Verse 1]
Father comes home from work
And he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he said, "What's goin' on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone"

[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

[Verse 2]
She wrote that she is tired of stepdaddy using her
Sayin' that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone, somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothin' to eat


[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock, yeah
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are, oh

[Bridge]
Save me (From this living hell)
Save me ('Cause I, I wanna help)
Save me (I'm tired and I'm mad)
Save me ('Cause this, it ain't no joke)
Save me ('Cause I'm out for blood)
Save me ('Cause I don't wanna ignore)
Save me (It's time I replied)
Save me ('Cause I, I wanna defeat)
Save me

[Post-Chorus]
Hee, hee
Hoo, hoo

[Verse 3]
Now, she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waitin' there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl, just let down your hair"
He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hot, girl, that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there, they told
He's arresting this little girl
Who's only twelve years old


[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Do you know where your children are? (Because it's now twelve o'clock)
Do you know where's your baby? (If they're somewhere out on the street)
Where's your baby?
Where's your baby? (Just imagine how scared they are)

[Post-Chorus]
Hee, hee (Do you know where your children are?)
Hee, hee, hee (Because it's now twelve o'clock)
Hee, hee, hee
Hee, hee, hee (If they're somewhere out on the street)
Hee, hee, hee (Just imagine how scared they are)
Where's your baby?
Where's your baby?
Where's your baby?
Hee, hee, oh
Children are
Where's your baby?
Hee, hee, hee, oh


[Chorus]
Do you know where your children are? (Where your children are)
Because it's now twelve o'clock  (Where your children are)
If they're somewhere out on the street (Where's your baby?)
Just imagine how scared they are (It's your baby, little girl)
Hee, hee, oh
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are (Yeah)

[Outro]
Hee, hee, hee
She's your baby
Know where your children are?
Do you know where your children
She's just a baby
She's just a baby
She's just a baby
She's just a baby
Hee, hee, oh
