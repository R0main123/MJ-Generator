Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tan
In her painted-on jeans
She dreams of fame, she changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
That chance again, babe
Ooh
[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams, ah
Ah, and she's giving hot tricks to men, just to get in
She was taught that that's not clean
She's headed for the big time, that means
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again


[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
That chance again, babe

[Verse 3: Taryll Jackson & Michael Jackson]
She gave up her life (Ooh) to follow her dreams (Chance again, babe)
Left behind everything for the movie scene
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad (Woo!)
Now that she got her dream, she became a star
It all looked so good, but only good from afar
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could
Now it's back to reality for Ms. Hollywood (Woo!)

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tanned
In her painted-on jeans
She dreams of fame, she changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time, that means
[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again


[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
That chance again, babe
You know it, baby

[Refrain: Michael Jackson & Taryll Jackson]
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (That chance again, babe)
She's Hollywood (Woo!), she's Hollywood
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (That chance again, babe)
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood (You know it, baby)
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (Again, babe)
Hollywood (Woo!), she's Hollywood
Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown
To pursue her movie star dreams (Again, babe)
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood (Woo!)

[Outro: Taryll Jackson]
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood
Hollywood, she's Hollywood
Hollywood, she's Hollywood
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood
