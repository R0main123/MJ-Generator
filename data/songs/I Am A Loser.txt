You laughed at me, you made me cry
You made a joke, then wonder why
I am a loser, I am a loser
I say hello, you say good-bye
I reach to you, you don't even try
I am a loser, I am a loser

[Refrain]
If losin' you makes me happy
Then why does it makes me cry
Losin' you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die?

[Verse 2]
I'm born to lose, you know it's true
And here I stand (Ooh-ooh), I'm losin' you
I am a loser, I am a loser
You are the one to let me know
You needed me, now I have to go
I am a loser (Alright), I am a loser

[Refrain]
If losin' you makes you happy
Then why does it makes me cry?
If losin' you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die? Ever die?


[Verse 3]
I am a fool, you know it's true
I believed in you (Ooh-ooh), now you don't even try
I am a loser (Alri-), I am a loser (Wh-what?)
What foolish kind of guy am I?
You break my heart, I wonder why
I am a loser (Alright), I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, alright)

[Chorus]
I am a loser (Baby), I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, alright)
I am a loser (Baby), I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, alright)
I am a loser, I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, alright! Alright!)
I am a loser (One more time, alright)
I am a loser (Ooh-ohh, let me win one time, alright)
I am a loser (I gotta win, gotta win, I can't lose)
I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, on my beggin' knees, on my beggin' knees)
I am a loser (Oh-ohh, alright), I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, hee, hee)
I am a loser (I am a loser, baby)
I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, I am a loser, baby)
I am a loser (I am a loser, uh)
I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, I am a loser, baby)
I am a loser (I am a loser, baby)
I am a loser (Ooh-ooh,I am a loser)
I am a loser (Let me win one time, let me win one time)
I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, Alright, hee)
I am a loser
I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, goodbye to you, goodbye to thee)
I am a loser (Goodbye to you, hello world)
I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, meet me tomorrow, meet me today)
I am a loser (Who knows who will win?)
