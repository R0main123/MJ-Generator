Hold me like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee, "You are my friend"
Carry me like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

[Interlude 1: Michael Jackson]
Hey
Yeah
Mother
Oh, baby

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?
But they told me a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end, but I'm only human

[Interlude 2: Michael Jackson]
Mother
Hey

[Bridge: Michael Jackson & Cleveland Orchestra]
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show it to me?
You'll be there for me and care enough to bear me


[Refrain: Michael Jackson & Choir]
Hold me (Show me)
Lay your head lowly (Told me)
Softly then boldly (Yeah)
Carry me there (I'm only human)
Lead me (Hold me)
Love me and feed me (Yeah, yeah)
Kiss me and free me (Yeah)
I will feel blessed (I'm only human)
Carry (Carry)
Carry me boldly (Carry me)
Lift me up slowly (Yeah)
Carry me there (I'm only human)
Save me (Lift me)
Heal me and bathe me (Lift me up, lift me up)
Softly you say to me
"I will be there" (I will be there)
Lift me
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly (Yeah)
Show me you care (Yeah)
Hold me (Hoo)
Lay your head lowly (It gets lonely sometimes)
Softly then boldly (I get lonely, yeah, yeah)
Carry me there (Carry me there)
Need me (Hoo)
Love me and feed me (Lift me up, hold me up)
Kiss me and free me (Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes)
I will feel blessed (Yeah)


[Spoken Word: Michael Jackson]
In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care? Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart
