22 ContributorsChicago (Original Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I, so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me

[Chorus]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never would have thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
And when I held her near
She would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me


[Chorus]
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (Look who's lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (Holdin' her to blame)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Holdin' her to blame)
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me but she was still your wife (Holdin' her to blame)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah
