Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all gonna end again

[Verse 2]
Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold?
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

[Chorus]
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

[Verse 3]
People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is takin' a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me, where were you
When your children cried last night?


[Verse 4]
Faces fill with madness, oh
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth

[Chorus]
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight

[Bridge]
And when that flag blows
There'll be no more wars (Ooh, why?)
And when all calls
I will answer all your prayers, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky, oh, no (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (Come on, I need some kind of sign)
If we all cry (Cry with me) at the same time tonight
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself, alright)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one, whoa (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
You can change the world (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You can touch the sky (Gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight


[Outro]
Change the world
