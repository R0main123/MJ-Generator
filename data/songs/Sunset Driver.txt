Hoo!
Hee!

[Verse 1]
All alone, she's in the ego zone
The word is out that you're doin' wrong
On the move, got fire in your shoes
By word of mouth, you are on the loose
You're livin' on sunset time (You're livin' on sunset time)
(Hoo!)
Feelin' bad, you're livin' much too fast
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
In the raw, they don't know what you saw
From word of mouth, you're breakin' every law

[Chorus]
Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Morning rider, you're a Saturday nighter (Ow)

[Verse 2]
On the go, got fever in your soul
You better not shout where you gonna go
Livin' hot, doin' what you should not
The break's on me then what do you get
We're livin' on sunset time (We're livin' on sunset time)
(Want that dime)
Shoot the breeze, you feel that she's the tease
Your night is free, what you want to be?
Who's to trust when livin' dangerous?
Tonight's your night, but this is what you lose


[Chorus]
Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Gettin' higher, you're a Saturday nighter (Ow)
(Hoo!)
(Pah-dah-da-da-dah-dah-dah)
(Hee!)

[Bridge]
You are there when the night's in town
Standin' there with the top of the round
They don't care about the things you used to say
You're like the cinema, you think there's nothin' wrong (Hoo!)

[Verse 3]
Goin' town, you do it every time
The word's got out that you're on the line
On the move, got fever in your shoes
The night's on you, what are you gonna do?

[Chorus]
Sunset driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Got to reach that driver, you're a Saturday nighter (Ow)


[Outro]
(Pah-dah-da-da-dah-dah-dah) (Hee-hee-hee)
(Ah) (Pah-dah-da-da-dah-dah-dah)
(Hoo!)
(Hee!)
(Hoo! Hee!)
(Hoo!)
(Hee!)
(Hoo!)
(Hee!)
(That's it, Janet)
(That's fine, Michael)
