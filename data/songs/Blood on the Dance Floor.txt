Ah, she got your number, ah. she know your game, ah
She put you under, ah, it's so insane, ah
Since you seduced her, ah, how does it feel, ah
To know that woman, ah, is out to kill?

[Refrain]
Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now, you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now, you do regret it

[Pre-Chorus]
To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side (Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now, she's out to get me
But I just can't take it, just can't break it

[Chorus]
Susie got your number, and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie got your number and Susie says it right


[Verse 2]
She got your number, ah, how does it feel, ah
To know this stranger, ah, is about to kill?
Ah, she got your baby, ah, it happened fast, ah
If you could only, ah, erase the past, ah

[Refrain]
Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now, you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now, you do regret it

[Pre-Chorus]
To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side (Blood on my side)
It seemed sincere while it was love and true romance
And now, she's out to get me
But I just can't take it, just can't break it

[Chorus]
Susie got your number, and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie got your number, you know Susie says it right (Hoo-hoo!)
Susie got your number, Susie ain’t your friend
(Ah, it's goin' down, baby)
Look who took you under with seven inches in (She's stuck seven inches in)
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife (It's goin' down, baby, ah)
Susie got your number, and Susie says it's right


[Post-Chorus]
It was blood on the dance floor (Ooh, blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor (Ooh, blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor (Ooh, blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor (Ooh, blood on the dance floor)
And I just can't take it, the girl won't break it
Hoo!
