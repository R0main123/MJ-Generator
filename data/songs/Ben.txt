Ben, the two of us need look no more

(Here and there)

And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)

I used to say "I" and "me"
Now, it's "us", now, it's "we"
(I used to say "I" and "me")
(Now, it's "us", now, it's "we")


[Verse 3]
Ben, most people would turn you away (Turn you away)
I don't listen to a word they say (A word they say)
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben

[Outro]
(A friend)
Like Ben
(Like Ben)
Like Ben
