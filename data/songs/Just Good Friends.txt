Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Hoo-hoo, dancin', hee!
Doggone, lover
C'mon, boy

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
I watched you on the floor, cheek-to-cheek
She's getting to you
You didn't see her eyes on me, no
She looked right through you
(Before you make) Before you make
(A big mistake) Remember
That looks can fool you, babe, hee
There's something I would sure appreciate
(If you can keep a secret)

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)
Baby loves me, no, she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me, ooh)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
And if they ask her
Tell 'em that we're just good friends
Dah-chika, chika-chika
Just good friends
Ah-chika, chika-ah-ooh
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, hee, aaow)
Just good friends


[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder, Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson]
You better take advice, never trust first impressions
I tried to hide this affair from their suspicions
So even if she's asking you to stay
You better know where you stand

[Refrain: Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, though she never shows she cares
(No, you won't see her kiss and hug me)
But my baby loves me, though she acts like I'm not there
(That doesn't mean she doesn't love me, ooh)

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson & Both]
Now, if they ask you
Just tell 'em that we're just good friends
Yes, just good friends
Dah-chika, chika-chika
Root-doo-doo-doo (Doot-do-do-do)
Just good friends

[Bridge: Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder & Both]
Listen up, hee
We've got a problem here, I can see the signs
I guess the lady is still making up her mind
Say we're just good friends (Oh)


[Chorus: Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson & Both]
Baby loves me, though she never shows she cares
No, you won't see her kiss and hug me (Just good friends)
My baby loves me, though she acts like I'm not there (Aaow)
You doggone lover, hee, no-no-no-no

[Outro: Stevie Wonder & Michael Jackson]
Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares (She loves me)
She doesn't kiss and hug me (Just good friends)
My baby loves me, she loves me, she loves me
Hee, hee, hee, hoo-hoo
My baby loves me, baby (Doo-doo)
My baby's gon' stay there, my baby loves me
Baby loves me, baby loves me, ooh-ooh-ooh! (Just good friends)
My baby loves me, she loves me, she loves me
She loves me, hee, hoo, hoo-hoo
You might gon' try to get her (Doo-doo)
I'm not gonna give up like that
Na-na-na-na-na, oh yeah! (Just good friends)
Baby love me, don't she? Oh-oh-oh
