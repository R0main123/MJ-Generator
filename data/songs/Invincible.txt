37 ContributorsInvincible LyricsThe title track from Jackson’s last album he made while alive is, surprisingly, not about himself being Invincible, but about the girl he so desires refusing to let him into her life. New Jersey rapper Fats… Read More [Intro: Michael Jackson]
Well, well, uh
Well, well, uh

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But, girl, you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you, but still, you say it ain't cool

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
If there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, and he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
So why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible
Girl won't give in to me
She's in—, she's invincible


[Post-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Well, well, see
Well, well
Come on now, oh

[Verse 2]
Now, many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me, how does it seem that you ain't checking for me?
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
And if there's somebody else (He can't love you like me)
And he, he says he'll treat you well (He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls (He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world (He can't trick you like me)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
Girl won't give in to me
She's in—, she's invincible


[Bridge: Michael Jackson, Fats]
Now some way, I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in this time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed (Uh-huh, Fats, MJ, Darkchild)
To do for you, my baby (Listen, come on)

[Verse 3: Fats, Michael Jackson]
Yo, mami, stop the frontin', I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
The chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, you'll have jetlag and still be fine (Come on now)
He can trip, but this money ain't long enough (Uh-huh)
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough (Uh-huh)
Now, the way you resisting, this ain't cool (For real)
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible (Come on now)
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
That girl won't give in to me
She's invincible (Oh)
Can you feel me?
She's invincible (Oh, yeah)
She's invincible
She's invincible (Yeah, now you tell me, baby)
Are you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Yeah)
You see the girl won't give in to me
She's invincible (Yeah, yeah, hey)
She's invincible (Hey)
Hee-hee
She's invincible (Hey)
She's invincible (Ooh)
She's in—, she's invincible


[Outro: Michael Jackson]
Why ain't you feelin' me?
She's invincible (Come on now)
I can't do anything
She's invincible (Come on now)
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible (Come on now)
That girl won't give in to me
She's in—, she's invincible (Yeah, yeah)
