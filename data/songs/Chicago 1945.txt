Chicago, Chicago, Chicago!
Chicago

[Verse 1]
It was Chicago 1945
Cubs lost that year, but Al Capone was found alive
They searched forty days, in the suburbs of the night
But they found him, alive
Alive
Young Joe DiMaggio hit his first home run
People gathered 'round, basking in the sun
Three girls disappeared, on a cold windy night

[Pre-Chorus]
Never to be found again, never to be found again, so

[Chorus]
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night?
You can’t hide the truth, so won’t you turn on the light?
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night?
Never to be found again, never to be found again
Found again, never to be found again
Found again (Found again)

[Verse 2]
It was so windy, joy had to be in the air (Hee hee)
People gather ‘round to see the world's fair
It was so happy, but sad in the truth
So much is goin’ on
They didn’t know the girls were missing, missing
You can’t choose what they say, and nobody can (Hee hee)
Because on the of the Chicago Tribune, feature the world's fair
Girl, didn't bother, you know it is the truth (Hoo hoo)


[Pre-Chorus]
Never to be found again, never to be found again, so

[Chorus]
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night?
You can’t hide the truth, so won’t you turn on the light?
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night?
Never to be found again, never to be found again
Be found again, never to be found again

[Break]
Found again (Found again, hoo hoo!)
Never to be found again (Hoo hoo, Found again)
You can’t hide anything (Hee hee, found again)
Chicago, we love you! (Hee hee, found again)
You can’t find anything (Found again)
Chicago, ooh-ooh, baby (Found again)
Chicago, chicago (Found again)
Chicago, chicago

[Verse 3]
It was Chicago 1945, Cubs lost that year
But Al Capone was found alive
Searched forty days, in the suburbs of the night
So much was goin’ on
They didn’t know the girls were missing, missing
Can’t choose what they say, nobody can
'Cause on the cover of the Chicago Tribune
Feature the world’s fair (Hoo hoo)
They didn't bother, though it is the scene


[Pre-Chorus]
Never to be found again, never to be found again, so (Hoo hoo, hee hee)
(Tell me)

[Chorus]
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night? (Tell me)
You can’t hide the truth, so won’t you turn on the light?
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night? (Tell me)
Turn on the light (You can’t hide the truth, oh no)
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night? (Tell me)
You can’t hide the truth, but won’t you turn on the light?
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night?
You can’t hide the truth, we’ll make you turn on the light
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night? (Tell me, ooh-ooh)
Turn on the light (Hoo hoo, hee hee)
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night? (Chicago! You didn’t find anything)
Turn on the light
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night?
You can’t hide the truth, we’ll make you turn on the light
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night?
Turn on the light (You didn’t find anything, didn’t find anything!)
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night?
You can’t hide the truth, we’ll make you turn on the light
Who solved that mystery late Chicago night? (Hee hee, hee hee)
Chicago!
