(Mm-mm)

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes, I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
I should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her (Oh)
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker (Doggone)
That girl, I can't take her (Oh)
I should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
She plays the game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now, she's thinking that I will never know
And she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same


[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her (That girl)
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker (Why'd you do it to me)
That girl (Oh), I can't take her (Doggone)
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker (Should've seen it coming, baby)
That girl, I can't take her (Oh)
Should have seen right through her (Doggone), she's a heartbreaker (Oh)

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
I never thought that I would stop dreaming about you
Stop being without you
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you
Start being without you
But I’ll find a way to go and start doing without you
Stop talking about you
And what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away

[Verse 3: Fats & MIchael Jackson]
I can't blame her, I thought it was love with this game, huh? (Huh?)
When you dealing with emotions, it's pain ma (Mm-mm) (Yeah, alright)
Take a closer look, you're dealing with a stranger
I can't change her, now (Mm)
The heart burner one place then you'll see (Right)
It won't heal from Pepcid AC (Mm-mm) (Uh-huh)
Ball-hard player, she a star player
I need LensCrafters, I ain't seen the heartbreaker, come on (Take it from me)


[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
That girl, I can't take her (Oh)
Should have known she was a heartbreaker (Doin' to me)
That girl (Oh), I can't take her (Doggone)
I should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker (Give it to me)
That girl, I can't take her (Oh)
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker (Should've seen it coming, baby)
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker (Should've seen it coming, baby)
That girl (That girl), I can't take her
Should have seen right through her, she's a heartbreaker (Oh)
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker (You knew how you did it)
That girl, I can't take her (You know what you're doing)
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her (Doggone)
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her (Oh)
Should have seen right through her
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker (Should've seen it coming baby)
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker (Aaow!)
[Outro]
That girl, I
Should have known she was a
That girl, I
Should have seen right through her
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen it coming, heartbreaker
That girl, I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
