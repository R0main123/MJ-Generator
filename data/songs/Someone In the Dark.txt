All alone wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend

[Chorus]
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you, never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart, you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars, I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark was you

[Spoken (E.T.)]
Thank you

[Verse 2]
Promise me, we'll always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me

[Chorus]
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky


[Outro]
Oh, I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me

[Outro Version]

[Verse 3]
Though you are gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I will remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tears

[Chorus]
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky

[Outro]
Oh, I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
