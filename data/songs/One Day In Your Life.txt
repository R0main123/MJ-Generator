33 ContributorsOne Day In Your Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around you
One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here

[Chorus]
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day

[Verse 2]
One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name and I'll be there

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day


[Verse 3]
One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name and I'll be there
