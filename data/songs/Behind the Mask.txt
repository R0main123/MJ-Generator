All along, I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword, it cuts you in its stab
All along, I knew you were a phony girl (Hee-hee)
You sit behind the mask and you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth, but that's your hiding place (Ah)
You say you love me, but it's hard to see (Ah)
'Cause when he's in your arms, you're throwing rocks at me

[Chorus]
Who do you love? (Hee-hee-hee)
Is it me (Hee-hee-hee) with you?
I don't know
Who do you love? (Hee-hee-hee)
I don't want it (Hee-hee-hee) if I can't have it
You know me, hoo

[Post-Chorus]
(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry, girl (Cry, girl)
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)
Ayy-ayy-ayy


[Verse 2]
I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
And when I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place (Hee-hee-hee)
So take off the mask, so I can see your face

[Chorus]
Who do you love? (Hee-hee-hee)
Is it me (Hee-hee-hee) with you?
I don't know
Who do you love, babe? (Hee-hee-hee)
I don't want it (Hee-hee-hee) if I can't have it
I know you, hoo

[Post-Chorus]
(Heaven must be wary) Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary) You got me scared, girl
(Insincere, empty tears) Every year, yeah, that's good
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?) You got me scared, girl
(Heaven must be wary) Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary) You know what you've been
(Insincere, empty tears) Every year, na-na-na
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?) Ayy-ayy-ayy

[Break]
Hee-hee-hee (Hey!), hee-hee-hee (Hey!)
Hee-hee-hee (Hee-hee), hee-hee-hee (Hee-hee)
Aaow!


[Verse 3]
I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
And when I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place (Hee-hee-hee)
So take off the mask, so I can see your face

[Chorus]
Who do you love? (Hee-hee-hee)
Is it me (Hee-hee-hee) with you?
I don't know
Who do you love, babe? (Hee-hee-hee)
I don't want it (Hee-hee-hee) if I can't have it
I know you
Who do you love? (Hee-hee-hee)
Is it me (Hee-hee-hee) with you?
I don't know
Who do you love? (Hee-hee-hee)
I don't want it (Hee-hee-hee) if I can't have it
I don't know

[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it
