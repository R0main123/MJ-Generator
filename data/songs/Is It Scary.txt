There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of a heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghostly haunting everywhere

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me because you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you want to to see eccentric oddities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
Is it scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby?
Ooh, babe


[Verse 2]
There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin, it lay open
Where a restless soul is smoking

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
So tell me, is it scary for you, baby? Tell me, hoo!
So tell me, is it crazy for you, baby?
Am I scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you?


[Bridge]
Masquerade the heart is to hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you seek of me
'Cause the heart reveals the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth
See, the evil one is you

[Chorus]
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, boy?
So tell me, am I scary for you, baby? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Am I scary for you, baby? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Is it scary for you, baby? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Am I scary for you, boy? (Hoo, hoo, hoo)

[Post-Chorus]
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)
(I don't want to talk about it)
[Outro]
Is this scary for you, baby?
Is this scary for you?
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you, baby? Oh
Oh, baby
