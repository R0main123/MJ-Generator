Tonight's story is somewhat unique
And calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh, yes, I did forget something, didn't I?
I forgot to introduce you to the monster

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
You're fearing me 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watchin' you when you sleep
When you're in bed, I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall
And when you scream, it's 'cause of me

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
I'm the living dead
The dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should feel threatened by me


[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere (Everywhere)
In one blink, I'll disappear
And then, I'll come back to haunt you

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
I'm tellin' you
When you lie under tomb
I'm the one watchin' you
That's why you got to be threatened by me (No, no)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened by me

[Verse 3: Rod Serling]
The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear


[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened (No, no, baby)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened

[Post-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
(You should be)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(While you sleep)
(E-e-e-e threatened)
(Every time)
(You should feel)
(Threatened)
(Half of me-e-e-e)
(Threatened by me)
(So you should feel thre-e-e-eatened by me)

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened (No, no, know it)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened (She speaks to me)
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should feel threatened (And you, threatened by me, hoo-hoo!)
You should be watchin' me (Come on, baby)
You should feel threatened (Yeah)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Hoo-hoo!)
Every time your lady speaks (I ain't threatened)
She speaks to me, threatened (Hoo-hoo, I ain't threatened)
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened by me


[Outro: Rod Serling]
What you have just witnessed
Could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't
It's the beginning
