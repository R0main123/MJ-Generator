[Babies crying]
Aaow!
Gone, baby

[Verse 1]
They wanna get my ass dead or alive
You know he really tried to take me down by surprise
I bet he missioned with the CIA
He don't do half what he say

[Chorus]
Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Tom Sneddon is a cold man
Tom Sneddon is a cold man

[Verse 2]
He out shock in every single way
He stop at nothing just to get his political say
He think he hot 'cause he's BSTA
I bet he never had a social life anyway
You think he brother with the KKK?
I bet his mother never taught him right anyway
He want your vote just to remain TA
He don't do half what he say

Tom Sneddon is a cold man (Gone, boy)
Tom Sneddon is a cold man, now
