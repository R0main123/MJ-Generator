As I drove across on the highway, my Jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped
Then got out and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, "Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there"

[Chorus]
Oh, take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name (Yeah, oh)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to (Oh) a place without (Yeah) no name

[Verse 2]
As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
At where kids are playin'
And people are laughin' and smilin' and nothin' to fear
She said, "This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness"
She turned around, looked down in my eyes
And started cryin'
Grab my hand, you've got a friend, oh


[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name (No name)
Take me to (See) a place without no name
A place without no name
Take me to (Can't believe) a place without (I can't believe) no name
Take me to a place without no name

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, yeah
Don't go, oh

[Bridge]
She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done, this really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave?
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world, oh

[Chorus]
Take me to (Don't go) a place
Without (I can't believe) no name (No name)
Take me to (See) a place without no name
Take me to (I can't believe) a place without (Don't go) no name
A place without no name
Take me to (See) a place without no name


[Outro]
No, no, no
La, la, la, la, la (La, la)
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la (See, a place without)
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la (I can't believe, I can't believe)
La, la, la, la (I can't believe it)
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
