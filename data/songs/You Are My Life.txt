Once, all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before, but now, it's all clear
You took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

[Chorus]
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are my life (You are my life)

[Verse 2]
Now, I wake up every day
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'Cause you love me


[Pre-Chorus]
You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I'm, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life

[Chorus]
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

[Bridge]
You gave me strength
When I wasn't strong
You gave me hope when all hope was lost
You opened my eyes when I couldn't see
Love was always here waiting for me


[Chorus]
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are my life
