Ooh, yeah
Mmm, eeh

[Verse 1]
There's indication
That someone else is standing on the ground
Across the nation
There's always people trying to pull you down
Now is the time
For us to spend this evening close together
Deep in the night
We're holding on to someone else's dream
Girl, can't you see?

[Chorus]
We need some starlight, starlight sun
There ain't no second chance
We got to make it while we can
You'll need the starlight, some starlight sun
I need you by my side, you give me
Starlight, starlight, starlight, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ooh


[Verse 2]
They're out to get you
There ain't no issue acting like a fool
Love can possess you
And make you see that heart is gonna move
High in the night
This magic's gonna keep us close together, yeah
We'll start to fly
'Cause this is the beginning of your life
Baby, tonight

[Chorus]
Give me some starlight, starlight sun
Is this the only chance?
We've got to make it while we can
You'll need the starlight, starlight sun
I need you by my side, so give me
Starlight, starlight, starlight (Starlight)

[Bridge]
Light up the world
Let the love start to churn in this masquerade
Take every memory and show me that this is no lie
(Gonna shine so bright) Give me your starlight tonight

[Verse 3]
There's indication
That someone else is standing on my ground
Across the nation
There's always people trying to pull you down
Now is the time
For us to spend this evening close together
Deep in the night
We're holding on to someone else's dream
Girl, can't you see?


[Chorus]
We need some starlight, starlight sun
There ain't no second chance
We've got to make it while we can
Give me the starlight, starlight sun
I need you by my side, so give me
Starlight, starlight
Give me starlight, starlight sun
There ain't no second chance
We've got to make it while we can
So give me the starlight, starlight sun
I need you by my side, so give me
Starlight, starlight
Give me starlight, starlight sun
There ain't no second chance
We've got to make it while we can
Give me some starlight, starlight sun
I need you by my side so give me
Starlight, starlight, starlight

[Post-Chorus]
Give me, give me that sun (Ah)
Give me, give me that sun (Ooh, now)
Give me, give me that sun (Ooh, yeah)
Give me, give me that sun (Ooh, babe)
Give me, give me that sun (We got to be together)
Give me, give me that sun (Starlight sun, ooh, now)
Give me, give me that sun (Girl)
Give me, give me that sun (Sun, ooh, babe)


[Outro]
Starlight (Starlight)
Starlight (Starlight)
Starlight (Starlight, girl)
Starlight, starlight, starlight (Give me that sun)
Da-da-da-da, starlight (Give me, give me that sun)
(We got to make it while we can, we got to be together)
Give some starlight
