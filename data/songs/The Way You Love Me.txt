13 ContributorsThe Way You Love Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was alone in the dark when I met you
Ooh
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I was alone, there was no love in my life
I was afraid of life and you came in time
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
Ooh

[Chorus]
I like the way how you are holding me
It does not matter how you are holding me
I like the way how you are loving me
It does not matter how you are loving me
I like the way how you are touching me
It does not matter how you are touching me
I like the way how you are kissing me
It does not matter how you are kissing me
You will see

[Verse 2]
It would not be long till we make vows, I bet you
Ooh
I thank the Heavens above that I met you
Ooh


[Pre-Chorus]
I was alone, there was no love in my life
I was afraid of life and you came in time
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
Ooh

[Chorus]
I like the way how you are holding me
It does not matter how you are holding me
I like the way how you are loving me
It does not matter how you are loving me
I like the way how you are touching me
It does not matter how you are touching me
I like the way how you are kissing me
It does not matter how you are kissing me
You will see

[Verse 3]
The world is a better place because you came in time
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine
I was afraid because I was hurt the last time
Ooh

[Chorus]
I like the way how you are holding me
It does not matter how you are holding me
I like the way how you are loving me
It does not matter how you are loving me
I like the way how you are touching me
It does not matter how you are touching me
I like the way how you are kissing me
It does not matter how you are kissing me
You will see


[Outro]
Ooh
