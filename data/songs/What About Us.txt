1 ContributorWhat About Us Lyrics[Verse 1]
What about sunrise?
What about rain?
What about all the things that you said we were to gain?
What about killing fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the things that you said was yours and mine?

[Pre Chorus 1]
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?

[Chorus]
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

[Verse 2]
What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace that you pledge your only son?
What about wising dreams?
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams that you said was yours and mine?


[Pre Chorus 2]
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?

[Chorus]
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

[Bridge]
I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know
Gonna be

[Chorus]
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

[Breakdown]
