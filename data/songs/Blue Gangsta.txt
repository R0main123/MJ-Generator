What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine
The Blue Gangsta

[Verse 1]
(Ah) What you gonna do?
'Cause I'm gonna get you
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
All the things you said
And the things you've done to me
You can no longer make me cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you done to me, baby
I can no longer smile, baby
And I've waited so long just to carry on
I'm the Blue Gangsta

[Chorus]
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (Blue Gangsta)
Look what you put me through (I'm the Blue Gangsta)
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine
I can never fall in love (The Blue Gangsta)
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (Oh, look at you)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta (Ah-ah-ah)
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine
I can never fall in love (The Blue Gangsta)


[Verse 2]
You tricked me nine-to-five
Lovin' you's a crime
People tellin' me that you got another guy
I've been abused
Watch me light the fuse
Said you'd be my wife, nothin' but big lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't know what I've done
Everything you got
Things you've done to me
Are comin' back to you
You know just what I've done
The things you've done to me
I'm the Blue Gangsta

[Chorus]
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (Oh no)
Look what you put me through (I'm the Blue Gangsta)
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine
I can never fall in love (The Blue Gangsta)
What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
You ain't a friend of mine (What you gonna do?)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta
(Look what you put me through, girl)
What you gonna do? (Oh no)
You ain't a friend of mine
I can never fall in love (The Blue Gangsta)
See


[Bridge]
I am so amused to the things you said
And the things you done done to me
There is nothin' in this world to make me change
(You make me wanna sing)
(Yeah, ah)
(Yeah, ah, ah)
The Blue Gangsta

[Chorus]
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (What you gonna do?)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta
(Look what you put me through, baby)
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine
I never thought I'd fall in love (The Blue Gangsta)
What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
You ain't a friend of mine (Ah, what you gonna do?)
Look what you put me through
(Look what you put me through, girl)
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta
What you gonna do? (Oh no)
You ain't a friend of mine
I never wanna fall in love (The Blue Gangsta)
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (You ain't a friend of mine)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta (You ain't a friend of mine)
What you gonna do? (Ooh, oh-oh, Lord)
You ain't a friend of mine
I never thought I'd fall in love (The Blue Gangsta)
What you gonna do? (What you gonna do?)
You ain't a friend of mine (See, you-you put me through)
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta (Yeah-ah)
What you gonna do?
You ain't a friend of mine (Oh no, no)
The Blue Gangsta
