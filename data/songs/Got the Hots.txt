Ooh, hee-hee
Hoo-hoo, hee
Hee-hee, hee
Ooh, ah, chika-chika

You know I can't get away from you, girl

I need all of the things you do, girl
(My body's aching)
Come on, baby, get up and rock it to the rhythm
Put out your heart to me
And lady, let me set you free

Ooh, chika-chika, hee

[Chorus]
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand-new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way (The magic's on its way)

Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling (Time), that's the day
