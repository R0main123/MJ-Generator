Ooh

[Verse 1]
I don't want to move when I'm in her hands
There's nothing I can do or say, ah
Put everything on hold, cancel all my plans
Tell everybody I'm away, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
She may be bad, but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she wants

[Chorus]
She's trouble (I know it)
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble (I know it, hee!)
She's trouble (I love it)
I know that when she does it (Hee)
I'm in trouble (I know it), ooh

[Verse 2]
Da, I never know what's running through her mind
No telling what she's going to do, eeh
Her every move is like a danger sign
Daring me to come on through, ayy
She may be bad, but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she wants


[Chorus]
She's trouble (I know it)
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble (I know it, hee!)
Oh, she's trouble (I love it)
I know that when she does it
I'm in trouble (I know it)

[Bridge]
(She's trouble) She knows what I like
I got a feeling I'm falling
(You're in trouble) Trouble
There's no hope in sight, I'm in way over my head

[Chorus]
She's trouble (I know it)
She only needs to touch me (Hee)
I'm in trouble (I know it, ooh)
She's trouble (I love it)
I know that when she does it
I'm in trouble (I know it, ooh)
She's trouble (I know it)
Only needs to— (Hee)

[Outro]
(I know it) Talk it, baby
(I love it) Hee
(I know it) Ooh
(I know it) Ooh
(I know it)
(I love it) Talk it, baby
(I know it)
(I know it) Ooh
(I know it)
(I love it) Hee
(I know it)
(I know it) Hee
(I know it) Talk that, baby
(I love it) Ooh
(I know it) Talk, my baby
(I know it)
(I know it) Hee
(I love it)
(I know it)
(I know it) Ooh
(I know it)
(I love it) Hee
(I know it)
