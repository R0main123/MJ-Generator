[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say, one day, you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fire's deep in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing


[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Every day, create your history
Every path you take, you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

[Interlude]
"Great ball history for Hank Aaron, 715th, look into the crowd"
"I'm the greatest of all time"
"By any means necessary"

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Don't let no one get you down
Keep moving on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self-motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing


[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Every day, create your history
Every path you take, you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day, create your history
Every page you turn, you're writing your legacy
("I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth")
Every hero dreams of chivalry ("I have a dream")
Every child should sing together in harmony

[Post-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

[Interlude]
"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation"

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family, oh

[Chorus: Choir, Michael Jackson, Choir & Michael Jackson]
Every day, create your history (History)
Every path you take, you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory (His glory) ("—ptember 1928")
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty, yeah
Every day, create your history, yeah (History) ("July 17th…")
Every page you turn, you're writing your legacy (Nations sing, sing)
Every hero dreams of chivalry, oh (All around the world, we sing) ("November 8th…")
Every child should sing together in harmony (Yeah, yeah, together, together)


[Post-Chorus: Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson & Child, Child]
A soldier dies (A soldier dies)
Her mother cries (A mother cries)
And the promised child (The promised child)
Shines in a baby's eyes (In a baby's eyes)
All nations sing (All nations sing)
Let's harmonize all around the world
