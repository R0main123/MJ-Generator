Oh, ooh-ooh
Alright, ah

[Verse 1]
Feels like a fire that burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around for every day to start
I haven't left you alone
Something about you, the stare in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away is killing me inside
I need your love in my life

[Chorus]
I wanna spend time 'til it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh
Ta-da-die

[Verse 2]
Fought in a battle where nobody won
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You can't run away, the past is said and done
I need us to carry on, oh-oh-oh


[Chorus]
I wanna spend time 'til it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
You tried everything you never thought of before
When you live, when you love, when you give them your all
Always give up some more
Nothing here means anything, no, we
I can live, I can breathe, I can die in my sleep
You're always there in my dreams

[Chorus]
I wanna spend time 'til it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
I wanna spend time 'til it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met (When we first met)
I wanna fall with you again


[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh)
Alright, alright
All of the time
Here in my heart
Let's go, great sound
