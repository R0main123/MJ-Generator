He gives a nervous smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been going on
She says, "Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand"

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
"Everything will be alright", he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid what they've been doing's not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand

[Guitar Solo]
Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, "It's you that makes me happy"
Whatever, whatever, whatever


[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
See, whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
See whatever happens, don't go of my hand
See whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, just don't let go of my hand

[Outro: Carlos Santana & Michael Jackson]
Thank you, man
Thank you, Carlos
