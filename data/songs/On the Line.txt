No sense pretending it's over, ah
Hard times just don't go away, ah
You gotta take that chip off your shoulder
It's time you open up, have some faith
Nothin' good ever comes easy, yeah
All good things come in due time, yes, it does
You got to have somethin' to believe in
I'm tellin' you to open your mind, hee

[Chorus]
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line, mmm-mmm

[Verse 2]
You see yourself in the mirror, ah
And you don't like what you see, ooh
And things aren't gettin' much clearer
Don't you think it's time you go for a change? Oh
Don't waste your time on the past, no, no
It's time you look to the future, oh
It's all right there if you ask
This time, if you try much harder
You will be the best that you can be, oh


[Chorus]
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line

[Bridge]
If you wanna make it right (If you wanna make it right)
And you wanna do it now (Do it now)
Then you gotta learn to try (Then you gotta learn to try)
And you'll make it work somehow (Make it work somehow)
No, nothin' in life comes free
And that's just the way it is, now
You gotta go for what you want
You gotta know what you've got to stand for (Live on)

[Chorus]
Gotta put your heart on the line (Gotta put it all on the line, you and me)
If you wanna make it right (Hoo)
You've got to reach out and try (Hoo, you and me)
Gotta put your heart on the line (Gotta put it all, gotta put it all)
If you wanna get it right (Hoo, hoo, hee)
Gotta put it all on the line (Hee)
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line
Gotta put your heart on the line (Hoo, hee)
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna get it right
Gotta put it all on the line
