17 ContributorsPeople of the World (Writer’s Demo) Lyrics[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Been to the Ukraine, and I
Da-da-di, da-dand, and I
Da-n-na, da-la-la, da-da-da
I've been to Florida, and I
Da-la-li, da-dand, and I
Da-n-na, da-n-la, da-de-da

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Da-ra-ra, di-ri-ri
In the Black Hills of North Virginia
What have I learned?
What have I learned?

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
People all over the world
People from country to country
One and the same in the world
And one song we sing
Life should be harmony
In this world of self-destruction
Nations lift your voices and sing

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
I've been to Naples, and I
I've been to Georgia, and I
Da-ni-na, da-nan-da, di-de-da
I've been to Estonia, and I
I've been to the ocean, and I
Da-nan-na, da-nan-na, di-de-da


[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Di-doo-doo, doo-doo-di
Di-di-di, and Black Virginia
What have I learned?
What have I learned?

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Choir, Michael Jackson, Choir]
People all over the world
People from country to country
One and the same in the world
And one song we sing
Life should be harmony
In this world of self-destruction
Nations lift your voices and sing

People all over the world
People from country to country
One and the same in the world (All over the world)
And one song they sing (dan-dan-dan da-da)
Life should be harmony (Di-di-di, di-di-di)
In this world of self-destruction (Di-di-di-di, di-di-ri-di-di)
Nations lift your voices and sing (Da-na-da-da, da-da-da-da, da)

People all over the world (Over the world)
People from country to country
One and the same in the world (All over the world)
And one song (Dan-dan-dan) they sing
Life should be (Da-da-da) harmony
In this world of self-destruction (Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
Nations lift your voices and sing (Da-na-da-da, da-da-da-da, da)
People all over the world (Over the world)
People from country to country
One and the same in the world (All over the world)
And one song they sing
Life should be harmony
In this world of self-destruction (di-di-di-di, di-di-ri-di-di)
Nations lift your voices and sing
Life should be harmony
In this world of self-destruction (di-di-di-di, di-di-ri-di-di)
Nations lift your voices and sing
Life should be harmony
In this world of self-destruction (di-di-di-di, di-di-ri-di-di)
Nations lift your voices and sing
