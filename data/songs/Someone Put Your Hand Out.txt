Never try to talk about it
It's got to sound good to me inside
I have to think about it

[Verse 1]
I'm so undemanding
'Cause they say love is blind
I've lived this life pretending
I can bear this hurt deep inside

The truth is that I'm longing
A love that's so divine
I've searched this whole world wishing
She'll be there time after time

[Chorus]
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love

[Verse 2]
I've lived my life the lonely
A soul that cries of shame
With handicapped emotions
Save me now from what still remains


I'll be your story hero
I'll serenade in rhyme
I'm just needing that someone
Save me now from the path I'm on

[Chorus]
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love

[Bridge]
When you say we will dance 'til the light of day
It's just like the children running with joy
When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay
It's because I'm needing that someone

[Chorus]
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Love
