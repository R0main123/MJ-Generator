Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Treatin' me bold and cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled your knife
She should have spied down his skin
Now, it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?

[Pre-Chorus]
Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a madman's out tonight

[Chorus]
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her 'bout us
No one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her 'bout us
No one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way


[Verse 2]
Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Treatin' me bold and cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled your knife
She should have spied down his skin
Now, it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?

[Pre-Chorus]
Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
And I told her, out tonight

[Chorus]
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her 'bout us
No one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her 'bout us
No one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way


[Insturmental Break]
Aaow!
Aaow!

[Pre-Chorus]
Too bad, forget it
'Cause it's Al Capone who's in it
So sad, regret it
'Cause a man is out tonight

[Chorus]
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her 'bout us
No one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way
You should have told her
Nobody ever showed her 'bout us
No one's sleepin'
Nobody should be grievin' this way

[Chorus]
You should have told her (Should have told her)
Nobody ever showed her 'bout us (Oh, ba-da)
No one's sleepin' (No one's lovin')
Nobody should be grievin' this way (Oh-ba-ba)
You should have told her (Should have told her)
Nobody ever showed her 'bout us (Oh, ba-da)
No one's sleepin' (No one's love)
Nobody should be grievin' this way (Aaow!)


[Outro]
Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Shot me down as cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled your knife
She should have spied down his skin
Now, it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away? (Aaow!)
Doo-doo-do-do-doo
Hee-hee-hee-hee! (Hoo!)
