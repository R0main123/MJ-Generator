24 Contributors(I Like) The Way You Love Me Lyrics[Intro]
Okay, this is the tempo, and this is the melody
"I was alone in the dark when I met you"
Drums
Like that, you know?

[Verse 1]
I was alone in the dark when I met you
(Ah-ooh-ooh)
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
(Ah-ooh-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I was alone, there was no love in my life
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)
I was afraid of life and you came in time
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
I like the way how you're holding me
(It doesn't matter how you are holding me)
I like the way how you're loving me
(It doesn't matter how you are loving me)
I like the way how you're touching me
(It doesn't matter how you are touching me)
I like the way how you're kissing me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissing me)
You'll see


[Verse 2]
It won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet you
(Ah-ooh-ooh)
I thank the Heavens above that I met you
(Ah-ooh-ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I was alone, there was no love in my life
(I was alone, there was no love in my life)
I was afraid of life and you came in time
(I was afraid of life and you came in time)
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight
(You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight)
(Ah-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
I like the way how you're loving me
(It doesn't matter how you are holding me)
I like the way how you're holding me
(It doesn't matter how you are loving me)
I like the way how you're touching me
(It doesn't matter how you are touching me)
I like the way how you're kissing me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissing me)

[Bridge]
The world's a better place 'cause you came in time
(The world's a better place 'cause you came in time)
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine
(You took away the rain and brought the sunshine)
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time
(I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time)
Ah-ah-ah


[Chorus]
I like the way how you're holding me
(It doesn't matter how you are holding me)
I like the way how you're loving me
(It doesn't matter how you are loving me)
I like the way how you're touching me
(It doesn't matter how you are touching me)
I like the way how you're kissing me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissing me)
You'll see

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh
Ah, ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
I like the way how you're holding me (Ooh-ooh)
(It doesn't matter how you are holding me)
I like the way how you're loving me (Ooh-ooh)
(It doesn't matter how you are loving me)
I like the way how you're touching me (Ooh-ooh)
(It doesn't matter how you are touching me)
I like the way how you're kissing me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissing me)
I like the way how you're holding me
(It doesn't matter how you are holding me)
I like the way how you're loving me
(It doesn't matter how you are loving me)
I like the way how you're touching me
(It doesn't matter how you are touching me)
I like the way how you're kissing me
