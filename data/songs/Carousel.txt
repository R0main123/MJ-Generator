26 ContributorsCarousel LyricsOn “Carousel”, Michael describes a love at first sight with a circus girl that pays him no attention. In the end, she walks into the crowd, leaving him standing there and still trying to talk to her.
… Read More [Verse 1]
She's from a world of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime, little children laughing
I'm from a world of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking, she kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd, oh

[Chorus]
I lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who ran away (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I was the clown and she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work, but we took our chances
What I can't recall is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember all of those faces
And now, all I have is memories, oh-woah

[Chorus]
I lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart on the carousel (Ooh)
To a circus girl who ran away


[Bridge]
Two different people in love for an instant
They say that the circus came today
Sometimes, I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know?

[Chorus]
I lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who ran away (I lost my heart)
I lost my heart (I lost) on the carousel (I lost my girl)
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart (Lost my heart) on the carousel (Lost my girl)
To a circus girl who ran away

[Outro]
(I lost)
Lost my heart (I lost my girl) on the carousel (Ooh)
To a circus girl (Oh, Lord, oh, lost, I lost her)
(I lost my heart) Lost my heart on the carousel
