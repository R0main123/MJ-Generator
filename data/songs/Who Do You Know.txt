I've lost my baby two years ago
Have you seen her?
She seems to be on a mission, wound up in a smile
Did you notice her all gone?
She was only playin' with love
Gonna get through this, all gone
Well, she seemed to up and left me
What an awful blow
Can you tell me, which way did she go? (Alright)

Oh, tell me, who do you know?
Who do you know?
Who do you know?
Who do you know?

She was only playin' with this guy
Did you notice this, all gone?
She seemed to be on a mission, bound up in his smile
Did you notice this? Oh, Lord
She was only missin', lovin' this guy
Gonna get through this, oh man (Ooh-ooh)
But she seemed to up and left me, what an awful blow
Can you tell me, which way did she go?


[Chorus]
Ah, tell me, who do you know? (Oh)
Who do you know? (I lost my baby)
Who do you know?
Who do you know? (Oh)

[Bridge]
'Cause she said that she was leavin' on a midnight train
Did you notice that she wasn't dreaming? Ooh
Said that she was grievin', who would only notice?
Oh, that message in her smile (In her smile, hee)
Alright (Alright)
But I'm only human too, human too

Who do you know? (Mmm)
Who do you know? (Can you tell me, which way did she go?)
