20 ContributorsHot Street Lyrics[Verse 1]
(A hot) Stone shaker is looking fine
She is a heart-breaker every time
She never seems to realize
That someday she will be crying too (Ooh!)
(She is) A sharpshooter that is moving fast
A slight cruiser loaded with gas
Slowing down to make a pass
You think it is going to hit
So why not take a chance?

[Chorus]
Because this is Hot Street (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street, yeah (Ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street (Ooh!)

[Verse 2]
(She is) A streetwalker when there is time to spare
She got that big spenders holding their share
A heart of gold, but no one cares (No one seems to care)
Within their eyes
Some young lovers are laughing loud
And there are some old suckers trying to get down
The evening spins around and round (Spins around and round)
Yes, people of the night smoking through the dark


[Chorus]
'Cause this is Hot Street, ooh! (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
Yeah, this is Hot Street, no (Ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street (Ooh!)

[Bridge]
(All night mover) Just trying to put a little fun in their lives
(Winners, losers) You see them standing on the corner in the neon light (Aoww!)
Tonight
(Ooh!)
Yeah, yeah, ooh
(Ooh!)

[Verse 3]
Some feeling you cannot explain
It is such a hard feeling lying in bed's flame
The evening starts to fall again (Starts to fall again)
It is time to come alive
So why not take a chance?

[Chorus]
'Cause this is Hot Street (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street, oh (Ready or not)
And the fantasy will never stop
'Cause this is Hot Street (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street (Ready or not)
And the fantasy will never stop


[Outro]
Burning it up
Fun on the run
Ready or not
Fantasy will never stop
Burning it up
Fun on the run
Ready or not
Fantasy will never stop
Burning it up
Fun on the run
Ready or not
Fantasy will never stop
