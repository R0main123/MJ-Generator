"All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us"
("Don't worry what people say, we know the truth")
"All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us"
("Enough is enough of this garbage!")
("Okay, alright, alright, alright")
"All I want to say is that
They don't really care about us"

[Verse 1]
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang, bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

[Verse 2]
Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
*** me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, **** me, don't you, "Black or white" me


[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

[Post-Chorus]
And tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am a victim of police brutality now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me off my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to Heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

[Verse 3]
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black man, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us


[Post-Chorus]
And tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame (Ooh)
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name (Ooh)
I can't believe this is the land from which I came (Ooh)

[Bridge]
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

[Verse 4]
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us


[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be
No, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 5]
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation (Hoo-hoo)
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food (Hoo-hoo)
Kick me, **** me, don't you wrong or right me (We're deep in fire)

[Chorus]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
We're deep in the fire (Hoo-hoo)
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
I'm here to remind you (Hoo-hoo)
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us (Hee)
Don't you sit back and watch the beatin'

[Outro]
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about—, hoo-hoo
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about—, hoo-hoo
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us, hee-hee-hee
Hee-hee, hoo-hoo
