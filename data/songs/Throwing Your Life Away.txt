15 ContributorsThrowing Your Life Away Lyrics[Intro]
Chop, hah!

[Verse 1]
I was strong enough to fight
I was never wrong but always right, dah
Bring it on me
I was trying to crack the code
But now I’m gonna lay a revelation
Dah, bring it on me
I was playing the underdog
I got my kicks but I got no home
Bring it on me
Life was sweet and life was bad
Got my time while I'm doin' that
Bring it on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I must fight
There’s no love in my life

[Chorus]
Don’t be throwing your life away
Throwing your life away (Oh!)
Don’t you find it so easy to just say no? (To just say no?)


[Verse 2]
I was livin' high and low
I got my kicks and I got my soul
Bring it on me
I was doing the underdog
I got my kicks but I got no home
Bring it on me
I was really doing bad
I got my time and I got my past
Dah, bring it on me
I was living in the right
I got my time without a sound
Dah, bring it on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I must fight
There’s no love in my life

[Chorus]
Don’t be throwing your life away
Throwing your life away (Oh!)
Don’t you find it so easy to just say no? (To just say no?)
Throwing your life away
Throwing your life away (Oh!)
Don’t you find it so easy to just say no? (To just say no?)
Da-da na-da da-da-da


[Bridge]
Release me
Someone say "Release me"
Someone say "Release me"
Someone say "Release me"
I've been through a fire
Dah, I've been through a lot (Chop)

[Chorus]
Throwing your life away
Throwing your life away (Oh!)
I love you
Hee!

[Outro]
Don’t you find it so easy to just say no?
To just say no?
