Lookin' over my photographs
I saw a picture of you an' me
Lovin' made deep
I had to write you just to tell you that
And to find out, if you really now missin' me, 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
If you don't need me
Just like I need you
If you don't love me
If you don't love me

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
What will I do girl?
'Cause I'm in love with you


[Verse 2]
I told the doctor that I'm broken-hearted
And my temperature has risen to a hundred and three
Why don't you write me back and save me girl?
Tell me what I wanna hear, like you're missin' me, but

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
If you don't need me
(If you don't need me)
If you don't want me
The way I want you
If you don't love me
If you don't love me

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
'Cause I'm in love with you
You!


[Bridge]
Oh pretty baby, I've been missing you
From such a long, long time ago
You changed your number and I couldn't call you
So I couldn't tell you so
I had to write you just to tell you that
I'm even kissin' on your photograph

[Outro]
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
Oooh-ooh
Baby baby baby!
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't want me
(If you don't love me)
Give it to me
(If you don't love me)
Oooh-ooh

Baby baby baby
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And I don't love you
(If you don't love me)
If you don't need me
(If you don't love me)
Give it to me
Give it!
If you don't want me
Baby tell me baby
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
If you don't want me
Love me
(If you don't love me)
I really wanna have it
(If you don't love me)
I'm beggin' like mad!


I dunno what I'm gonna do
All I know is
Baby baby baby baby!

If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
If you don't love me
(If you don't want me)
And if you don't want me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't need me
(If you don't love me)
I am beggin' like mad!
(If you don't love me)
I am beggin' like mad!
(If you don't love me)
Give it to me baby!
(If you don't want me)
And if you don't want me
(If you don't love me)
If you don't need me
(If you don't love me)
Give it to me baby!
(If you don't love me)
If you don't want me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
Aow!
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
