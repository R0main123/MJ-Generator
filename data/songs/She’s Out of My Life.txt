She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

[Verse 2]
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years, she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
She's out of my hands

[Bridge]
So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

[Verse 3]
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside!
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life
