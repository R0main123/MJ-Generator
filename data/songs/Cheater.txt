Oooh

Just put your dime on the line, 'cause I own you (Ho!)

I am indestructible
I pray to leave my body
Do not you ever call

[Verse 3]
I don't care a jack bone about what cha' do (Ho!)
Just sign your name on the line, baby, I own you (Doggone it)
(Ho!)

[Chorus]

Give it to me, what!
What!, get jack on me…

[Pre-Chorus]
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel (Ah-uh)
One blow to the head is all you need
I ain't takin' it ya
