Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

[Hook 1]
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

[Verse 2]
Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of ya 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

[Hook 2]
And I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

[Bridge]
It seems you don't know, we reached the highest mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heavens
I can really feel it when you're near, oh-hoo


[Verse 3]
And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

[Outro]
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do (Doo-doo-doo, I'll be loving you)
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do ('Cause you're always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (Doo-doo-doo, loving you)
Loving you, that's what I want to do (Always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do (Always on my mind)
Loving you, that's what I want to do
Loving you, that's what I want to do
