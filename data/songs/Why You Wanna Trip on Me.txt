You got strange diseases, ah, but there's no cure
You got many doctors that aren't so sure

[Chorus]
(Why)
(Why) Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why)
(Why, why)
(Why you wanna)
(Why) Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why)
Stop trippin'

[Verse 2]

You got gang violence and bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people with no food to eat
With no clothes on their back and no shoes for their feet
We've got drug addiction in the minds of the weak

We've got streetwalkers walking into darkness
Tell me, what are we doing to try to stop this?

(Why, why) (Tell me, baby)
(Why you wanna)
(Why) Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why)
(Why, why)
(Why you wanna)
(Why) Why you wanna trip on me?
(Why) Ooh, stop trippin', yeah, stop trippin'
Everybody just stop trippin'
