The lyrics pertain to despair over being left… Read More [Verse 1]
I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever and a day we'd live as one
We made our vows, we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret that she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue, tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter and it doesn't seem right
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune, still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure 'cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me, did she find in someone else?

[Post-Chorus]
(Who is it?)
Is it a friend of mine?
[(Who is it?)](27716580)
Is it my brother?
[(Who is it?)](27716580)
Somebody hurt my soul now
[(Who is it?)](27716580)
I can't take this stuff no more


[Verse 2]
I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever that we'd live our life as one
We made our vows, we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me for such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth, but see, what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter and it doesn't seem right
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune, still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure 'cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter, she just up and ran away

[Post-Chorus]
Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely


[Bridge]
(Hee-hee, hee-hee)
Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it
I never was, we never were
Just won't stop
Don't bother me, don't bother me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
To me, I'm bothered
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee) and it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee)
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune, still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Body), 'cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me, did she find in someone else?
And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me) and it doesn't seem right (Da da da da)
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune, still, I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm bothered every day
And she didn't leave a letter, she just upped and ran away (You can really say I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter and it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune, still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Don't be, don't be, don't be judging) 'cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me (Don't be, don't do), did she find in someone else? (Can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me) and it doesn't seem right (This won't cut it)
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune, still, I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure (Don't be judging) 'cause I'm bothered every day (Don't be, don't be)
And she didn't leave a letter, she just upped and ran away (Can't you really feel I'm lonely?)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee!) and it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune, still, I cry alone at night (She don't, she don't want me)
Don't you judge of my composure, 'cause I'm bothered every day (She don't, she don't, she don't need it)
And she didn't leave a letter (She don't, she don't want it), she just upped and ran away (Is it my brother?)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me, you just couldn't) and it doesn't seem right
'Cause the wheel has brought no fortune (Da da, da da, da da, da), still, I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Hee!), 'cause I'm lying to myself (Hee!)
And the reason why she left me, did she find in someone else? (I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)
