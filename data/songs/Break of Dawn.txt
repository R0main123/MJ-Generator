Hold my hand, feel the touch of your body cling to mine
You and me, making love all way through another night
I remember you and I walking through the park at night
Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow, just touch and go
Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love
People talk, people say what we have is just a game
Oh, I'll never let you go, come here, girl
Just got to make sweet love till the break of dawn

[Chorus]
I don't want the sun to shine, I want to make love (Break of dawn)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart (Break of dawn)
I don't know what I'm gon' do, I can't stop lovin' you (It's the break of dawn)
I won't stop till break of dawn, makin' love

[Verse 2]
Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes, you've got me nervous yet
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise
There's imagination I bet you've never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream about those things you never known?

[Pre-Chorus]
(Break of dawn, break of dawn)
There's no sun up in the sky
(Break of dawn, break of dawn)
I can see it in your eyes
(Break of dawn, break of dawn)
Girl, you got to understand
It's the way that I love you
Let me show you I'm your man
Break of dawn


[Chorus]
I don't want the sun to shine, I want to make love (It's the break of dawn)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart (It's the break of dawn)
I don't know what I'm gon' do, I can't stop lovin' you
I won't stop till break of dawn, makin' love (It's the break of dawn)
I don't want the sun to shine, I want to make love (I don't no no, it's the break of dawn)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart (Oh, it's the break of dawn)
I don't know what I'm gon' do, I can't stop lovin' you
(Woo! Break of dawn)
I won't stop till break of dawn, makin' love (Oh)

[Bridge]
Let's not wait, the sun is out, let's get up and let's get out
It's the day, a brand new day, let's both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, makin' love till it's dark
Let me move, let me soothe, till the break of dawn and you know it's true, oh

[Chorus]
I don't want the sun to shine, I wanna make love (Break of dawn)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart (Break of dawn)
I don't know what I'm gon' do, I can't stop lovin' you (It's the break of dawn)
I won't stop till break of dawn, makin' love (I don't wanna)
I don't want the sun to shine, I wanna make love (I don't know, I don't know, no, no, no, no, no)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart (It's the break of dawn)
I don't know what I’m gon' do, I can't stop lovin' you (No, no, no, It's the break of dawn)
I won't stop till break of dawn makin' love (Oh)
I don't want the sun to shine, I wanna make love (I don't want, I don't want, it's the break of dawn)
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart (It's magic, it's, it's dawn)
I don't know what I'm gon' do, I can't stop lovin' you (I don't know, no, no, the dawn)
I won't stop till break of dawn makin' love


[Outro]
Break of dawn
