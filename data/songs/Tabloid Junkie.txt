63 ContributorsTabloid Junkie LyricsOn this song, Michael addresses people that believe everything the media says, and sings about their lies and how ignorant the media is.[Intro]
In the news today from the strange and weird fact file
Singer Michael Jackson sleeps in a oxygen chamber
The singer says that the hyperbaric chamber has the benefits of reversing the aging process
(overlapping voices)
This just in, singer Michael Jackson has a shrine to Elizabeth Taylor in his Encino home

[Verse 1]
Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
It's the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next, for you to resurrect?
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
It's the blackmail story in all your glory

[Pre-Chorus]
It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen, you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it (Read it)
And you don't have to eat it (Eat it)
To buy it is to feed it (Feed it)
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves?


[Chorus]
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
(Though everybody wants to read all about it)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual

[Verse 2]
In the hood, frame him if you could
Shoot to kill, to blame him if you will
If he dies, sympathize
Such false witnesses, damn self-righteousness
In the black, stab me in the back
In the face, to lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
It's the headline stories of all your glory

[Pre-Chorus]
It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it (Buy it)
And they won't glorify it ('Fy it)
To read it sanctifies it ('Fies it)
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves?


[Chorus]
(Baby! Baby!)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
(Everybody wants to read all about it)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen (Believe it, baby)
Don't make it factual
(See, but everybody wants to believe all about it)
Just because you read it in a magazine (Release me)
Or see it on the TV screen (Somebody release me)
Don't make it factual
(See, but everybody wants to believe all about it)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
She's blonde and she's bisexual

[Bridge]
(Overlapping voices)
Everybody got something to read about
Everybody got something rude to say
Everybody got some viscous scandal
Everybody's got some news to handle
I despise what theyâ€™re talking about
Everybody's talkin' 'bout every scandal
Then we got something to for someone to hold
A scandal and something for the news to say


[Pre-Chorus]
Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anythin' for news
And you don't go and buy it (Buy it)
And they won't glorify it ('Fy it)
To read it sanctifies it ('Fies it)
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves?
Slander! You say it's not a sin
But with your pen, you torture men
But why do we keep foolin' ourselves?

[Chorus]
(Baby! Baby!)
Just because you read it in a magazine (Believe it, baby!)
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual (Baby!)
Though everybody wants to read all about it (Yeah, oh-oh)
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to read all about it (You better believe it)
Just because you read it in a magazine (Baby!)
Or see it on the TV screen (Believe it, baby!)
Don't make it factual (See, so many times, not a friend of mine)
Just because you read it in a magazine (Somebody, release me!)
Or see it on the TV screen (Believe it, baby!)
Don't make it factual (You better believe it, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Just because you read it in a magazine (Yeah, yeah)
Or see it on the TV screen (Baby!)
Don't make it factual, actual (Believe it, baby! Oh-oh)
You're so damn disrespectable
