(Money)
(Money) Lie for it, spy for it
Kill for it, die for it

[Verse 1]
So you call it trust, but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church, read the holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge, you're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you, my friend, but

[Pre-Chorus]
If you show me the cash, then I will take it (Ah)
If you tell me to cry, then I will fake it (Ah)
If you give me a hand, then I will shake it
You would do anything for money

[Chorus]
Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil


[Verse 2]
Insurance? Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? (Ah) I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your god is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles, the idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers

[Pre-Chorus]
If you know it's a lie, then you will swear it (Ah)
If you give it with guilt, then you will bear it (Ah)
If it's taking a chance, then you will dare it
You would do anything for money

[Chorus]
Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Hee, ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Hee, ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil


[Bridge]
You say you wouldn't do it for all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man, then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie, then I will tell him
If it's dealing with God, then you will hell Him
You would do anything for money

[Chorus]
Anything (Ah), anything for money
Would lie for you, would die for you (Ah)
Even sell my soul to the devil (Ah)
Anything, anything (Ah), anything for money (Ah, ah)
Would lie for you (If you want it, you can earn it with dignity), would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything (Vanderbilt, Morgan), anything for money (Trump)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Rockefeller)
Even sell my soul to the devil (Carnegie)
Anything, anything (Getty), anything for money (Getty)
Would lie for you, would die for you (Getty)
Even sell my soul to the devil (Getty, Getty, Getty!)
Anything, anything (Money makes the world go round)
Anything for money (Money makes the world go round)
Would lie for you (Money makes the world go round)
Would die for you (Don't sell it)
Even sell my soul to the devil (Money makes the world go round)
Anything, anything (Money makes the world go round)
Anything for money (Money makes the world go round)
Would lie for you (Money makes the world go round)
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil (Money makes the world go round)
Anything (Money makes the world go round)
Anything for money (Money makes the world go round)
Would lie for you (Money makes the world go round)
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil (Money makes the world go round)
Anything, anything
Anything for money (Money makes the world go round)
Would lie for you (Money makes the world go round)
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devil
