I am your toy, I am your boy
I am the moonlight, you are the spring
Our lives are sacred things
You know I always will love you, I am forever

[Chorus]
I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around
When things would hurt you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free
When living seemed so hard to be
And things would hurt ya?
I am forever

I am your friend through thick and thin
We need each other, we'll never part
Our love is from the heart
We'll never say, "I don't need you"
We are forever

[Chorus]
Wasn't it I who said that you arе free
When living seemed so hard to be
And things would hurt you?
I am forеver
I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around
When things would hurt you
I am forever


[Bridge]

When things are shady, what comes what may
We do get by
I was the only one around when things would hurt you

[Chorus]
I am forever

[Verse 3]
I am your toy, I am your boy
I am the moonlight, you are the spring
Our lives are sacred things
You know I always will love you, I am forever

[Chorus]
I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around
When things would hurt you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free
When living seemed so hard to be
And things would hurt you?
We are forever

[Outro]
We are forever, uh-huh
We are forever (What you do? What you live for?)
We are forever (What you do? What you live for?)
