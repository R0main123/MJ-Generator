(*screams*)
Hoo!
(*screams*) No!
Hoo! Hee!
(*screams*)
Hoo (*screams*)

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Ah, tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
The lies are disgustin'
So what does it mean? Damn it
Kickin' me down
I got to get up, ah
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it
Hee, hoo-hoo (*screams*)

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson]
Peek in the shadow (Hoo-hoo!)
I come into the light (Hee-hee!)
If you tell me I'm wrong (Hee-hee!)
Then you better prove you're right
And you're sellin' out souls
But I, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight


[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson]
With such confusions, don't it make you wanna scream? (Confusion, scream) (Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(Intrusion, scheme) (Hoo!)
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize (Ooh, wow-wah, ooh, wow-wah)
Somebody, please have mercy (Ooh, wah)
'Cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson]
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream (Hee, hee!)
Ah, well stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me (You just stop it, baby)
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream (You just, you just)
[Verse 3: Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson]
I'm tired of you tellin', ah (Tellin')
The story your way, ah (Story your way)
You're causin' confusion, ah (Confusion)
You think it's okay, damn it
You keep changin' the rules (Hoo-hoo!)
While I keep playin' the game (Hoo-hoo!)
I can't take it much longer (Hoo-hoo!)
I think I might go insane (Baby!)
*screams* Now baby, hoo!


[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson]
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream?
(Confusion, scream) (Make you wanna scream?)
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
(Intrusion, scheme) (Keep schemin', baby)
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie (Ooh, wow-wah, ooh, wow-wah)
Oh Father, please have mercy (Ooh, wah)
'Cause I just can't take it

[Chorus: Michael Jackson & Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson]
So stop pressurin' me (Stop your pressure)
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me (Hee-hee!)
Make me wanna scream (Hoo, hoo!)
Ah, stop pressurin' me (Stop your pressure)
Just stop pressurin' me (Stop your pressure)
Stop fuckin' with me
Make me wanna scream (Hee!)

[Bridge: Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson]
Oh my god, can't believe what I saw
As I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice, all the injustice (*screams*)
