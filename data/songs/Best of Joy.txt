I am your joy, your best of joy
I am the moonlight, you are the spring
Our life's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you, I am forever

[Pre-Chorus]
I am the one who came when you fell down (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I was the only one around (The only one)
When things would hurt you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When living seemed so hard to be
And things would hurt you?

[Chorus]
I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (We are forever)

[Verse 2]
I am your friend through thick and thin
We need each other, we'll never part
Our love is from the heart
We never say, "I don't need you"
We are forever


[Pre-Chorus]
I am the one who said that you are free (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When living seemed so hard to be (The only one)
And nothing would cheer you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
When all the walls came tumblin' down
When things would hurt you

[Chorus]
I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (We are forever)

[Bridge]
You are the sun that lights up the sky
When things are shady, let come what may
We do get by
I was the only one around (Ooh-ooh-ooh, the only one)
When things would hurt you

[Chorus]
We are forever (I am forever, alright)
We are forever (I am forever, uh-huh)
We are forever (Ah, what you do? What ya live for?)
We are forever (What you do? What ya live for? Our love is strong)
We are forever (Uh-huh, what you do? What ya live for? Uh-huh)
We are forever (Uh-huh, alright)
I am forever, I am forever (Ah, uh-huh, alright, ooh)
We are forever (Uh-huh, alright)
We are forever (Hee)
I am forever
I am forever
