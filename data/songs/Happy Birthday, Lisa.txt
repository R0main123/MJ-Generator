10 ContributorsHappy Birthday, Lisa Lyrics[Verse 1]
Lisa, it's your birthday
God blessed you this way
You gave me the gift of a little sister
And I'm proud of you today

[Chorus]
Lisa, it's your birthday
Happy birthday, Lisa
Lisa, it's your birthday
Happy birthday, Lisa

[Verse 2]
I wish you love and goodwill
I wish you praise and joy
I wish you better than your heart desires
And your first kiss from a boy

[Chorus]
Lisa, it's your birthday
Happy birthday, Lisa
Lisa, it's your birthday
Happy birthday, Lisa

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh
Lisa, it's your birthday
Happy birthday, Lisa
Lisa, it's your birthday
Happy birthday, Lisa
