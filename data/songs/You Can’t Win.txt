You can't win, you can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
People keep saying things are going to change
But they look just like they're staying the same
You can't win, way over your head
And you only got yourself to blame

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
You can't win, child
You can’t break even
And you can't get out of the game

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, the world keeps moving
And you're standing far behind
People keep saying, things will get better
(Just to ease your state of mind)
(So you lean back)(And you smoke that smoke)
(And you drink your glass of wine)

[Chorus]
Sayin' you can't win, child
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game


[Bridge: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, you can't win, no way
If your story stays the same
(You ain’t winning) No, no
(But it's nice to see you, I'm awfully glad you came)
(Better cool it, 'cause it ain't about losin')
Then the world has got no shame

[Chorus]
You can't win, child
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, you can't break even
Ain’t the way it's supposed to be
(You'll be spending) No, no, oh
(Your little bit of money)
While someone else rides for free
(Learn your lesson) Hoo-hoo!
(Refuel your mind before some turkey blows out your flame)

[Outro: Michael Jackson (The Crows)]
You can't win, child
(No, you can't win) [4x]


You can't win, child
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
You can't get out of the game
You can't get out, a-hoooooo!
You can't get out of the game now, hah!
No, no, ah, d'ah
