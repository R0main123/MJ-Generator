There we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you
And often be your friend
There you are, I walk alone
Telling me to love you
And often be your end

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She told me she was givin' me
A life-time love forever true
But she left me for another man
And I’m singin' to keep from feelin' blue

[Chorus]
All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh, Lord)
Tschada dada dada naa
Tschada dada dada naa
Come on, set me free
(Set me free)

[Verse 2]
There I am, so all alone
And I'm so sad and lonely
Tell me, what will I do
I can’t reveal, I’m holdin' on
I want you still to love me
I feel I am your fool


[Pre-Chorus 2]
They told me you should sing a song
Of happy when you're feelin' blue
I been singin' for so very long
Still cryin', tell me, what should I do

[Chorus]
All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh, Lord)
Tschada dada dada naa
Tschada dada dada naa
Come on, set me free
(Set me free)

[Harmonica Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She told me she'd be givin' me
A life-time love so guaranteed (Guaranteed)
But she left me for another man
And I’m singin', cryin' helplessly
But I’ll keep singin'

[Chorus]
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh, Lord)
Tschada dada dada naa (Oh, my, my)
Tschada dada dada naa
Come on, set me free
(Set me free)
(Woah-oh-oh)


Tschada dada dada naa (Oh, no) (And I keep crying)
Tschada dada dada naa ('Cause I wanna be free)
Tschada dada dada naa (Hold on, hold on)
Come on, set me free
(Set me free)

[Outro]
All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa (Wo-oh-oh-oh, Wo-oh-oh-oh, Woo-oh)
Tschada dada dada naa (Woah, I, oh)
Tschada dada dada naa
Come on, set me free
(Set me free)
(Wo-oh-oh-oh) (Wo-oh-oh-oh)
