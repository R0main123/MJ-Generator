6 ContributorsDream Away Lyrics[Intro]
Aah-aah, aah
Aah-aah, aah

[Verse 1]
We could sail away our dreams to our Never Neverland
We could kiss the world and wish upon a distant star
I could say the future, hope for us has different promises
And the answers lie deep inside your lovely eyes
I could look inside your mind and tell that you’re far away
Don’t say a word, just let me whisper inside your ear
I could see that you are trying hard to be my friend
All the words you wanna say is all I want to hear

[Chorus]
And I can’t give you promises
And we can wish upon a star
But I can’t break these promises
But I’ll give you all thе love that I can give
And things in dreams and what is rеal
Like sharing truths and tales of youth and love

[Verse 2]
Did you ever stop to think just why I look inside your eyes?
‘Cause this love we have is just a dream away
I could tell you’re crying ‘cause you really love me, girl
And the answers lie deep in the words I have to say
I could say the future, hope for us has different promises
And the life we need is just a life away
I could look inside your mind and tell that you love me, girl
And the words you want to hear, is all I wanna say


[Chorus]
And I can’t give you promises
And we can wish upon a star
But I can’t break these promises
But I’ll give you all the love that I can give
And things in dreams and what is real
And sharing truths and tales of youth and love (Aah-aah, aah)
And love (Aah-aah, aah)

[Interlude]
Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa pa, pa pa pa (Aah-aah, aah)
(Aah-aah, aah)

[Chorus]
No, I can't give you everything
And we can wish upon a star
And I can't break these promises
But I’ll give you all the love that I can give
And things in dreams and what is real
And sharing truth and tales of youth
And all the love that I can give
And things and dreams and what is real
And sharing truth and tales of youth
And..

[Outro]
Did you ever stop to think how much I really love you?
La la la la la la la
The love, I'm thinkin' of you
Pa pa pa pa pa pa pa
Ooh, ooh...
