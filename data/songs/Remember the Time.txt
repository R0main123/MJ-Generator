Haha, I don't know
Bet you wanna try
Every time you see, hahaha

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember (I'll make you remember)
Back in the fall? (I'll make you remember)
We'd be together (I'll make you remember)
All day long (I know you remember)
Do you remember (I'll make you remember)
Us holding hands? (I'll make you remember)
In each other's eyes (I'll make you remember)
We'd stare (I know), tell me

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?


[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so," "I'll never let you go"

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you remember (I'll make you remember)
Back in the spring? (I know you remember)
Every morning (I'll make you remember)
The birds would sing (I know you remember)
Do you remember (I'll make you remember)
Those special times? (I know you remember)
They'll just go on and on (I'll make you remember)
In the back of my mind

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

[Bridge]
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we did
Now, baby


[Chorus]
Do you remember the time (Do you remember?)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time? (Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time ('Cause I remember)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time? (All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time? (Remember, my baby)

[Post-Chorus]
(Remember the time) Hoo!
(Remember the time) Do you remember, girl?
(Remember the time) On the phone, you and me
(Remember the time) 'Til dawn, 'til three
What about us, girl?
(Remember the time) Do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time) Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach
(Remember the time) You and me in Spain
What about, what about?
(Remember the time) Brrt-ahh, da-da, da
Brrt-da-ba-da
(Remember the time) Hoo, in the park
(Remember the time) After dark, do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time) Do you, do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time) Yeah, yeah, hoo!


[Outro]
(Remember the time, remember the time)
