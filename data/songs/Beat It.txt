They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it (Rrr)
You better run, you better do what you can (Ooh)
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man (Ooh)
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Just beat it (Beat it), beat it (Beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Show them how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (Beat it), just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it), just beat it (Beat it, ooh)

[Verse 2]
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (Rrr)
You have to show them that you're really not scared (Ooh)
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare (Ooh)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad


[Chorus]
Just beat it (Beat it), beat it (Beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Show them how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (Beat it), beat it (Beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Show them how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right

[Bridge]
Just beat it (Beat it, beat it, beat it)
Beat it (Beat it, beat it)
Beat it (Beat it, beat it)
Beat it (Beat it, beat it)
Beat it (Beat it, beat it)
[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Beat it (Beat it), beat it (Beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Show them how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right (Who's right)
Just beat it (Hoo-hoo; Beat it), beat it (Beat it)
No one wants to be defeated (No one)
Show them how funky and strong is your fight (Hee-hee, hee-hee-hee)
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (Beat it), beat it (Beat it)
No one wants to be defeated (Oh, no)
Show them how funky and strong is your fight (Hoo-hoo, hee-hee)
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right (Hoo)
Just beat it (Beat it), beat it (Beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Show them how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right (Who's right)
Just beat it (Beat it), beat it (Beat it, hoo-hoo)
No one wants to be—
