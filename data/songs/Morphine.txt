He got flat, baby, kicked in the back, baby
A heart attack, baby, I hate your father
A hot fix, honey, he dug the ditch, baby
You make me sick, baby, so unreliable
I felt the swine, baby, all down the line, daddy
I hate your kind, baby, so unreliable
A hot buzz, baby, he want the buzz, baby
Another drug, baby, you don't deserve us

[Chorus]
Trust in me, trust in me
Put all your trust in me
You're doin' morphine, hoo!

[Interlude]
"You heard what the doctor said"
"First conclude—"
"I take it—"
"A matter pre—"
"That your mind is—"
"Hahaha"

[Verse 2]
He got a place, baby, kicked in the face, baby
He hate your race, baby, you're not the liar
You're every lick, baby, your dog's a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby, you talk survival
She never cut from me, she never fuck, baby
I got to work, baby, you're just a rival
A razor blade, daddy, right up your leg, daddy
You're throwin' shade, daddy, so undesirable


[Chorus]
Trust in me, just in me
Put all your trust in me
You're doin' morphine
Go on, baby

[Bridge]
Relax, this won't hurt you
Before I put it in
Close your eyes and count to ten
Don't cry, I won't convert you
There's no need to dismay
Close your eyes and drift away

[Refrain]
Demerol, Demerol
Oh God, he's taking Demerol
Demerol, Demerol
Oh God, he's taking Demerol

[Bridge]
He's tryin' hard to convince her
To give more of what he had
Today, he wants it twice as bad
Don't cry, I won't resent you
Yesterday, you had his trust
Today, he's taking twice as much


[Refrain]
Demerol, Demerol
Oh, God, he's taking Demerol, hee-hee
Demerol, Demerol
Oh my, he's got his Demerol
Hee-hee, hoo, ooh!

[Interlude]
"You heard what the doctor said"
"First conclude—"
"I take it—"
"A matter pre—"
"That your mind is—"
"Hahaha"

[Verse 3]
He got shit, baby, your dog's a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby, you are a liar
Is truth a game, daddy? Deep in the fame, baby
You're called a Saint, baby, you're so beloved

[Chorus]
Trust in me, trust in me
Put all your trust in me
She doin' morphine, hoo!


[Outro]
You just sit around, just talkin' of it
You're takin' morphine, hoo! Go on, baby
You just sit around, just talkin' about it
You're takin' morphine, hoo-hoo
Just sit around, just talkin' nothin' about it
She takin' morphine, honey?
You just sit around, just talkin' about it
You're takin' morphine, hoo-hoo
You just sit around, just talkin' nothin'
And takin' morphine, hoo-hoo-hoo
Something's goin' down, baby, hoo
You're talkin' morphine, go on, baby
Hoo, hoo, morphine
Do it, hoo, keep takin' morphine
Morphine, morphine
