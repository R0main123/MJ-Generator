Mhm, aah-ha
Yeah-yeah, alright
Love her, love her
Yeah-yeah, aah-ha

[Verse 1]
Ooh, hey, my girl
She does something to my chemistry
And when I'm close, I'm sure
I raise her temperature about three degrees
Every day, yeah
In every way, she makes my motor purr
And I reciprocate
My life I dedicate to lovin' her

[Chorus]
So we've got a good thing going (Good thing going)
A real good thing going, yeah (Good thing going)
That girl and me (Woo-doo-do-do-doo)
And I don't have to ask
'Cause I know it's gon' last eternally
Now, let me tell you what we got

[Verse 2]
Understanding
Whenever handing any alibis
Instead of what you do
Where you been or what's the use?
We make it nice (Uh-huh, it's a nice, nice time)


[Chorus]
You see, we've got a good thing going (Good thing going)
A real good thing going, yeah (Good thing going)
That girl and me (Woo-doo-do-do-doo)
And she don't have to ask
'Cause she knows it's gon' last eternally

Said we've got a good, good, good, good, good thing going
(A real good thing going) Yeah, yeah
That girl and me (Woo-doo-do-do-doo)
And we don't have to ask
'Cause we know it's gon' last eternally

Said we've got it together (Said we've got a good thing going)
We've got our thing together (A real good thing going, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, alright (Woo-doo-do-do-doo)
We've got our thing together
Uh-uh, we sure 'nuff got it going on

Said we got a good thing going
A real good thing going
