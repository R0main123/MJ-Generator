One, two, three, jam
Jam, jam, jam
Jam, if you wanna get up, then jam
Jam, jam, you wanna get up, then jam
Jam, jam, jam, you wanna get up, jam
You wanna get up, jam, you wanna get up, jam
You wanna get up, jam, you wanna get up, jam
You wanna get up, jam, you wanna get up, jam
You wanna get up, jam, you wanna get up and jam
Jam, jam, you wanna get up and jam
Jam, jam, said you wanna get up and jam
Jam, jam, said you wanna get up and jam
Jam, jam, said you wanna get up and jam

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it


[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Jam (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't too much (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me to
Jam, it ain't (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't, don't you (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Jam, it ain't (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't too much (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me to
Jam, it ain't (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't, don't you (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me to
Jam (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't too much (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me to
Jam, it ain't (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't, don't you (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me to


[Verse 3: Heavy D]
Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal hat, the man is Mike, so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first, I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
'Cause it ain't too hard to

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Jam, it ain't (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't too much (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me to
Jam, dad gone it (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't, don't stop (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me to
Jam, it ain't (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't, don't you (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me to (Hoo-hoo!)
Jam, it ain't (Jam it) (Hoo-hoo!)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't, don't you (Jam it) (Hoo-hoo!)
It ain't too much for me to
Jam (Hoo!)


[Bridge: Heavy D, Michael Jackson]
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam, it ain't too hard for me to jam, it ain't too hard for me to jam (Get down, hoo!)
Ooh!
Ooh!

[Instrumental Break]
Dad gone it!

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
Jam, it ain't (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't, don't you (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me to
Jam (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't too much (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me to
Jam (Dad gone it) (Jam it)
Uh-huh (Dad gone it), It ain't too much stuff (Hee-hee!)
(Jam) It ain't too much (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me to
Jam, too much (Jam it)
It ain't too much stuff
(Jam) It ain't, don't you (Jam it)
It ain't too much for me to

[Outro: Michael Jackson]
Dad gone it
Dad gone it, give it, baby
Give it to me
Won't you really give it to me?
Got to give it (Uh-huh)
You just want to give it
