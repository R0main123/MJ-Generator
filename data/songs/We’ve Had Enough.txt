Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dim light
From one more violent crime

[Interlude]
She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die
Did God say that you could decide?
You saw he didn't run
And that my daddy had no gun

[Verse 2]
In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand

He's awaken, ground is shakin'
His father grabs his hand
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain


[Pre-Chorus]
He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
If they're for peace, why is there war?
Did God say that they could decide
Who would live and who would die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids

We're innocently standing by
Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice
Only God should decide
Who would live and who will die
There's nothing that can't be done
If we raise our voice as one

[Chorus]
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough


They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from you, baby
We can't take it
We've already had enough

(Deep in my soul baby)
Deep in your soul and let God decide
(Deep in my soul)
It's up to me and I am still alive
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough

It's going down baby
(Just let God decide)
It's going on baby
(Just let God decide)
Deep in my soul baby

We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't, we can't
We've already had enough


You're my lover
We've already had enough

They've gotta hear it from me, in the dark from me
As my brother, it's too much from me
As my brother, baby
As my lover
We've already had enough (Aaow!)

[Outro]
Oh lord, oh lord
Deep in my soul, babe
Oh no
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
Please don't let it
Oh no, oh no
Why did you do it?
Oh, don't do it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Please don't do it
Why did you do it?
Oh no, hold on
Yeah
