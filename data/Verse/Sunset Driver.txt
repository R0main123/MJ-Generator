All alone, she's in the ego zone
The word is out that you're doin' wrong
On the move, got fire in your shoes
By word of mouth, you are on the loose
You're livin' on sunset time (You're livin' on sunset time)
(Hoo!)
Feelin' bad, you're livin' much too fast
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
In the raw, they don't know what you saw
From word of mouth, you're breakin' every law

On the go, got fever in your soul
You better not shout where you gonna go
Livin' hot, doin' what you should not
The break's on me then what do you get
We're livin' on sunset time (We're livin' on sunset time)
(Want that dime)
Shoot the breeze, you feel that she's the tease
Your night is free, what you want to be?
Who's to trust when livin' dangerous?
Tonight's your night, but this is what you lose

Goin' town, you do it every time
The word's got out that you're on the line
On the move, got fever in your shoes
The night's on you, what are you gonna do?
