This is it, here I stand
I'm the light of the world, I feel grand
Got this love, I can feel
And I know, yes, for sure, it is real

This is it, I can say
I'm the light of the world, runaway
We can feel this is real
Every time I'm in love, that, I feel

This is it (This is it), I can feel (I can feel)
I'm the light of the world, this is real
Feel my song, we can say
And I tell you I feel that way
