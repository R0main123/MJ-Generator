Baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me

Baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it was ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Ooh baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
