Ah, tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
The lies are disgustin'
So what does it mean? Damn it
Kickin' me down
I got to get up, ah
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it
Hee, hoo-hoo (*screams*)

Peek in the shadow (Hoo-hoo!)
I come into the light (Hee-hee!)
If you tell me I'm wrong (Hee-hee!)
Then you better prove you're right
And you're sellin' out souls
But I, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight
