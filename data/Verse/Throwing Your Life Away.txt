I was strong enough to fight
I was never wrong but always right, dah
Bring it on me
I was trying to crack the code
But now I’m gonna lay a revelation
Dah, bring it on me
I was playing the underdog
I got my kicks but I got no home
Bring it on me
Life was sweet and life was bad
Got my time while I'm doin' that
Bring it on me

I was livin' high and low
I got my kicks and I got my soul
Bring it on me
I was doing the underdog
I got my kicks but I got no home
Bring it on me
I was really doing bad
I got my time and I got my past
Dah, bring it on me
I was living in the right
I got my time without a sound
Dah, bring it on me
