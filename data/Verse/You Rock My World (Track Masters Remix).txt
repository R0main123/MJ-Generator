My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain the things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need

H to the izzo
Make ya leave your Jerky Boy like Frank Rizzo
My neck and back
Jigga voice his music, forget the track
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Before we lose it, Trackmasters bring it back, let's go

In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is fully complete
Our love is true because of you
You're doin' what you do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for allmy life
(Searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find
(Whoa...oh...oh...)
Such a perfect love that's so right (Whoa, girl)
