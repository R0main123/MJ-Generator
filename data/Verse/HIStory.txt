He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say, one day, you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fire's deep in his eyes

Don't let no one get you down
Keep moving on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self-motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history
