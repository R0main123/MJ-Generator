You'll never make me stay, so take your weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before, but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time, you won't seduce me

She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree

She said "I have to go home, 'cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone, why don't you come with me?"
I said "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright"
