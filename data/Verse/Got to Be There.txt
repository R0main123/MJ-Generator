So I've got to be there (Got to be there)
Got to be there in the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she's my girl
When she says, "Hello, world!"
(Got to be there)
I need her sharing the world beside me

That's why I've got to be there (Got to be there)
Got to be there where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me
She's home (Home, she's home)
(Home, she's home) Yeah
