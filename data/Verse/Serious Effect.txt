I got to feeling of giving you, I
Won't jump back
She wonâ€™t let it
I got a feeling
Like nothing around
And I'm so damn, so damn glad about it
She don't smoke, she don't do weed
She don't hash, she don't dope
But she's a liar
I got a feeling like nothing around
And I'm so damn, so damn glad about it

She's serious
Makin' me delirious, I'm curious
Next thing I know what was hitting us
Enjoying the animal magnetism
She's too hot to touch, too cool for criticism
Each and every things like a mini movie being filmed
'Cause I'm the captain and our body's the helm
I'm shivering, quivering
I smile while I'm delivering
Get some love and passion
It's never been so intense and spiritual like
In sense of above, against and all off in silence
Then I scream like a man out of his wits
'Cause that's how serious her serious effect is
