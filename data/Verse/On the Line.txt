You see yourself in the mirror, ah
And you don't like what you see, ooh
And things aren't gettin' much clearer
Don't you think it's time you go for a change? Oh
Don't waste your time on the past, no, no
It's time you look to the future, oh
It's all right there if you ask
This time, if you try much harder
You will be the best that you can be, oh
