Feels like a fire that burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around for every day to start
I haven't left you alone
Something about you, the stare in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away is killing me inside
I need your love in my life

Fought in a battle where nobody won
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You can't run away, the past is said and done
I need us to carry on, oh-oh-oh
