I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now, I wonder why
I break down when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie?
Is it just a lie
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true
Make a dream come true

I tried to mastermind it
By saying let you be
But everytime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still, you said goodbye
Still, you said goodbye
