I took my baby on a riverboat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited 'bout the way that things could've been
She said that I don't care
I wore a face no one could recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of takin' pictures, autographs, then they grabbed
My joy had turned to pain

I am a cover of a magazine, what a scene
They know my every news
"Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine"
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you want to take a ride, look behind
Someone is followin' you
You try to get away, you turn real fast, but too bad
They know your every move

I'd like to take some time and get away, then they say
"Is that boy still alive?"
The weak, they'd really start to take the pills, what a thrill
Only the strong survive
