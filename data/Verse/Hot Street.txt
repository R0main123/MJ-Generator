(She is) A streetwalker when there is time to spare
She got that big spenders holding their share
A heart of gold, but no one cares (No one seems to care)
Within their eyes
Some young lovers are laughing loud
And there are some old suckers trying to get down
The evening spins around and round (Spins around and round)
Yes, people of the night smoking through the dark

Some feeling you cannot explain
It is such a hard feeling lying in bed's flame
The evening starts to fall again (Starts to fall again)
It is time to come alive
So why not take a chance?
