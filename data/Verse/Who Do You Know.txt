She was only playin' with this guy
Did you notice this, all gone?
She seemed to be on a mission, bound up in his smile
Did you notice this? Oh, Lord
She was only missin', lovin' this guy
Gonna get through this, oh man (Ooh-ooh)
But she seemed to up and left me, what an awful blow
Can you tell me, which way did she go?

I've lost my baby two years ago
Have you seen her? (Alright, yeah)
Well, she seemed to up and left me
What an awful blow
Can you tell me, which way did she go? (Ooh, girl)
