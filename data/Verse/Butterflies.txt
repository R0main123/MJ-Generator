All you got to do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my call
When I'm tryna get through
Keep me wonderin' why when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you

All I got to say is that I must be dreamin', it can't be real
You're not here with me
See, but I can feel you near to me, yeah
I caress you, let you taste a just so blissful listen
I would give you anything, baby
Just make my dreams come true
Oh, baby, you give me butterflies
