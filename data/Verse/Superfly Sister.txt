He wanna do somethin' freaky to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around ya, girl
He wanna shake it up, shake it down, doin' it right
He wanna jump back, half flap, doin' it right
He wanna lay you down, turn it up, shakin' it loose
He wanna fly high, nigh high, baby, for you'se
He wanna motormouth, float around, baby, the back
He wanna shake it up, shake it down, movin' 'round, haha

He wanna do somethin' freaky to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around ya, girl (Oh)
He wanna glue it up, keep it high, deep in the night
He wanna eyeball, get hard, playin' it right
He wanna turn the key, work the sheets, move to the left
He wanna hot scrub, hot love, makin' it wet
He wanna give hot, jump shot, move to the left
He wanna time bar, slam dunk, hahaha
