They say I'm different, they don't understand
But there's a bigger problem that's much more in demand
You've got world hunger, not enough to eat
So there's really no time to be trippin' on me
You've got school teachers who don't wanna teach
You've got grown people who can't write or read
You got strange diseases, ah, but there's no cure
You got many doctors that aren't so sure
So tell me

We've got more problems than we'll ever need
You got gang violence and bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people with no food to eat
With no clothes on their back and no shoes for their feet
We've got drug addiction in the minds of the weak
We've got so much corruption, police brutality
We've got streetwalkers walking into darkness
Tell me, what are we doing to try to stop this?
