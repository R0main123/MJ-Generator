You're beautiful, you're wonderful, incredible, I love you so
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you, girl, it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do if I can't be with you
The world could not go on, so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be?
If the angels came for me, I'd tell them, "No"

Unthinkable
Me sittin' up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be movin' on (Movin' on)
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissin', touchin' her
Couldn't take nobody lovin' you the way we were
What good would Heaven be?
If the angels come for me, I'd tell them, "No"
