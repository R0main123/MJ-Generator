Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes, I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no

She plays the game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now, she's thinking that I will never know
And she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same

I can't blame her, I thought it was love with this game, huh? (Huh?)
When you dealing with emotions, it's pain ma (Mm-mm) (Yeah, alright)
Take a closer look, you're dealing with a stranger
I can't change her, now (Mm)
The heart burner one place then you'll see (Right)
It won't heal from Pepcid AC (Mm-mm) (Uh-huh)
Ball-hard player, she a star player
I need LensCrafters, I ain't seen the heartbreaker, come on (Take it from me)
