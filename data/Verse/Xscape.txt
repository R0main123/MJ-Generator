Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The system's in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away, so I can free my mind
Escape is what I need, away from electric eyes

I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change
