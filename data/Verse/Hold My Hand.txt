This life don't last forever (Hold my hand)
So tell me what we're waitin' for? (Hold my hand)
We're better off bein' together (Hold my hand)
Than being miserable alone (Hold my hand)

The nights are getting darker (Hold my hand)
For, and there's no peace inside (Hold my hand, oh yeah)
So why make our lives harder (Hold my hand) Yeah, by fighting love tonight? (So, be there, baby)
