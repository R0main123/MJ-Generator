My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk, the way I talk
I cannot explain
The things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
So stay with me, fulfill my dreams
I'll be all you'll need

In time, I knew that love would bring
Such happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I've waited patiently
And girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do
