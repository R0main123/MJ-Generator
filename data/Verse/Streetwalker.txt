You're pretty, baby, are your kisses for your lover?
I really get it when you're next to me, yeah yeah
I'm so excited how you give it all your lovin'
I got it comin' and it's ecstasy
Streetwalkin' baby

'Cause every day, I watch you paint the town so pretty
I see you comin' in and off on my thought, yeah, yeah
You don't believe me then you can ask my brother
'Cause every day at six, home alone

I hear you walkin' 'cause your body's talkin' to me
I chase you every step of the way, yeah, yeah
An invitation to some faraway hot island
If I can show you, baby, home with me

I have to tell you that you give me strong hot fever
My every thought is you and that's a fact, yeah, yeah
I'd like to take you places, how about New York City?
Or Paris, France? What do you think of that?
