We could sail away our dreams to our Never Neverland
We could kiss the world and wish upon a distant star
I could say the future, hope for us has different promises
And the answers lie deep inside your lovely eyes
I could look inside your mind and tell that you’re far away
Don’t say a word, just let me whisper inside your ear
I could see that you are trying hard to be my friend
All the words you wanna say is all I want to hear

Did you ever stop to think just why I look inside your eyes?
‘Cause this love we have is just a dream away
I could tell you’re crying ‘cause you really love me, girl
And the answers lie deep in the words I have to say
I could say the future, hope for us has different promises
And the life we need is just a life away
I could look inside your mind and tell that you love me, girl
And the words you want to hear, is all I wanna say
