I don't want to move when I'm in her hands
There's nothing I can do or say, ah
Put everything on hold, cancel all my plans
Tell everybody I'm away, hey

Da, I never know what's running through her mind
No telling what she's going to do, eeh
Her every move is like a danger sign
Daring me to come on through, ayy
She may be bad, but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she wants
