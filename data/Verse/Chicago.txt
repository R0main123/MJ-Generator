I never woulda thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me

I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man
Swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I'm holdin' her to blame
