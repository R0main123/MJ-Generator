Where did you come from, lady?
And ooh, won't you take me there?
Right away, won't you, baby?
Tenderoni, you've got to be
Spark my nature, sugar, fly with me

Nothin' can stop this burnin' desire to be with you
Gotta get to you, baby
Won't you come? It's emergency
Cool my fire yearnin'
Honey, come set me free
