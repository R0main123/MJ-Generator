He got a place, baby, kicked in the face, baby
He hate your race, baby, you're not the liar
You're every lick, baby, your dog's a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby, you talk survival
She never cut from me, she never fuck, baby
I got to work, baby, you're just a rival
A razor blade, daddy, right up your leg, daddy
You're throwin' shade, daddy, so undesirable

He got shit, baby, your dog's a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby, you are a liar
Is truth a game, daddy? Deep in the fame, baby
You're called a Saint, baby, you're so beloved
