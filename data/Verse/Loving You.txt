Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of ya 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you

And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed
