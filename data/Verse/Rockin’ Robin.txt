Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flappin' their wings singin', "Go, bird, go"

Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started goin' steady and a-bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole

Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
Started goin' steady and a-bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole
