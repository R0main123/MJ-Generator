Our love's an ocean
Give me a notion 'cause
You know I'll never part
Our love goodbye
Our love a season
Give me a reason 'cause
You know I'll never part
Our love goodbye
And together, we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
No place too far for us
We don't need it

Our love’s an ocean
Give me a notion ’cause
You know I'll never see
A thing to see
I love a reason
Give me the truesome ‘cause
You know I'll never part
Our love's a goodbye
And together, we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
(Give you my heart)
No place too far for us
We don't need it
