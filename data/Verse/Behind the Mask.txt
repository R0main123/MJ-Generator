I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
And when I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place (Hee-hee-hee)
So take off the mask, so I can see your face

I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
And when I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place (Hee-hee-hee)
So take off the mask, so I can see your face
