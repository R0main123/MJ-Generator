Told me that you're doing wrong
Word out shocking all along
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwing rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done nothin' for me
You are disgusting me
(Yeah, yeah)
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad

Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from another hole
Tell her what somebody told
What do you want from me
What do you want from me
Tired of you hunting me
(Yeah, yeah)
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad

Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ's on my team, theme
Reality brings forth realism
It's the man of steel, organism, T.W.I.S.M
I'm full of trisim, take charge like manila
9-5 Shaq represent with the thriller
Grab my crotch, twist my knees, and I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad, who are you?
