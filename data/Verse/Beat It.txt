They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (Rrr)
You have to show them that you're really not scared (Ooh)
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare (Ooh)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
