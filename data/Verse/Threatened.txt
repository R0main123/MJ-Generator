You're fearing me 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watchin' you when you sleep
When you're in bed, I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall
And when you scream, it's 'cause of me

You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere (Everywhere)
In one blink, I'll disappear
And then, I'll come back to haunt you

The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear
