Don't need no fortune or fame
I just want you close to me (There's no mystery)
No time for castles in space
Or living in make believe (Don't you just see)
Ooh, I'd trade it all for just a rainy day
As long as I know you'll be there, girl

Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl
