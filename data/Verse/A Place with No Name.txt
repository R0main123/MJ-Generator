As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
At where kids are playin'
And people are laughin' and smilin' and nothin' to fear
She said, "This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness"
She turned around, looked down in my eyes
And started cryin'
Grab my hand, you've got a friend, oh
