I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same

They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em, "I ain't second to none"

Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from, it's where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life being a color
