Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
It's the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next, for you to resurrect?
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
It's the blackmail story in all your glory

In the hood, frame him if you could
Shoot to kill, to blame him if you will
If he dies, sympathize
Such false witnesses, damn self-righteousness
In the black, stab me in the back
In the face, to lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
It's the headline stories of all your glory
