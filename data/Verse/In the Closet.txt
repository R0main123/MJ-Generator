She's just a lover who's doin' me by
It's worth the givin', it's worth the try
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it
She wants to give it

It's just a feelin', you have to soothe it
You can't neglect it, you can't abuse it
It's just desire, you cannot waste it
Then if you want it, then won't you taste it?
She wants to give it

If you can get it, is it worth the try?
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's achin', you have to rub it
She wants to give it
