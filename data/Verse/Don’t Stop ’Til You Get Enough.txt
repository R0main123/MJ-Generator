Lovely is the feeling now
Fever, temperature's rising now
Power (Oh, power) is the force, the vow
That makes it happen
It asks no questions why, ooh
So get closer (Closer now) to my body now
Just love me
'Til ya don't know how, ooh

Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain't nothing like a love desire, ooh
I'm melting (I'm melting) like hot candle wax
Sensation (Ah, sensation)
Lovely where we're at, ooh
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complaining, ooh
'Cause this is love power, ooh

Heartbreak enemy despise
Eternal (Oh, eternal) love shines in my eyes, ooh
So let love take us through the hours (Oh, let love)
I won't be complaining, hoo (No, no)
'Cause your love is alright, alright, ooh
