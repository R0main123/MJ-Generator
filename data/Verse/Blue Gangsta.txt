(Ah) What you gonna do?
'Cause I'm gonna get you
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
All the things you said
And the things you've done to me
You can no longer make me cry

You tricked me nine-to-five
Lovin' you's a crime
People tellin' me that you got another guy
I've been abused
Watch me light the fuse
Said you'd be my wife, nothin' but big lies
