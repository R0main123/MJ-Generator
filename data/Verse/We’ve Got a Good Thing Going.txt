Ooh, hey, my girl
She does something to my chemistry
And when I'm close, I'm sure
I raise her temperature about three degrees
Every day, yeah
In every way, she makes my motor purr
And I reciprocate
My life I dedicate to lovin' her

Understanding
Whenever handing any alibis
Instead of what you do
Where you been or what's the use?
We make it nice (Uh-huh, it's a nice, nice time)
