You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all gettin' loud
If you take the chance and do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down

Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Wanna see an exhibition (A-hee!)
Better do it now before you get too old
