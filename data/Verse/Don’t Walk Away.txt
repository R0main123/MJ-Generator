Don't walk away
See, I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you’ll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray?

I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long, now, all I do is cry
Can’t we find some love to take this away?
'Cause the pain gets stronger every day
