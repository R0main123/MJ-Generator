I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" (Hee-hee!)
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said "You know my name"
(She called me!)
"And don't you pretend you never did me before"
(Don't you, don't you, do it!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't you) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)
