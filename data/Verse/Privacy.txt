Some of you still wonder why one of my friends had to die
To get a message across, that yet you haven't heard
My friend was chased and confused like many others I knew
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away
She get no second chance, she's ridiculed and harassed
Please tell me why? (Hold on) (Mercy)
Now, there's a lesson to learn, respect's not given, it's earned
Stop maliciously attackin' my integrity
