You're the one that I adore
Just kiss me once, I wanna know you
Feel the vibe that I can feel in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Yesterday was when I felt down
I start tryin' to make you think that I was around
You know, life was just a thing, she don't pass the way I do
Because I want to be

Yesterday was when I felt down
I start tryin' to make sense like I was around
And was tryin' to make the way to see, what a thing I do
You know 'cause I want to be
