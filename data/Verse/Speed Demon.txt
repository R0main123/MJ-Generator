I'm headed for the border, it's on my mind
And nothing really matters, I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror, is he hot on my tracks?
Is he getting nearer? I feel some heat is on my back

Ain't nothing gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speeding on the midway
I gotta really burn this road
