I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered, "No" to me
Well, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon

I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
The day that she'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon, ooh-ooh
