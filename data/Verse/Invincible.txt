If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But, girl, you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you, but still, you say it ain't cool

Now, many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me, how does it seem that you ain't checking for me?
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream

Yo, mami, stop the frontin', I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
The chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, you'll have jetlag and still be fine (Come on now)
He can trip, but this money ain't long enough (Uh-huh)
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough (Uh-huh)
Now, the way you resisting, this ain't cool (For real)
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible (Yeah, yeah)
