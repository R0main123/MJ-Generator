You know I can't get away from you, girl
(You've got me shakin')
I need all of the things you do, girl
(My body's aching)
Come on, baby, get up and rock it to the rhythm
Put out your heart to me
And lady, let me set you free

I got a heart beating just for you, girl
(You've got me shakin')
I've tried all, but I can't get you, girl
(My body's aching)
Come on, baby, get up and rock it to the rhythm
(Rock it, baby, hoo!)
Put out your heart to me
And lady, let me set you free (Let me set you free, girl)
