Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

Looking out across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
