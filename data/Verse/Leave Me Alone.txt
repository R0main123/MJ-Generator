I don't care what you talkin' 'bout, baby
I don't care what you say
Don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama
I don't care anyway
Time after time, I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb, baby
All is goin' my way

There was a time I used to say "Girl, I need you"
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now, who is sorry now?
You got a way of makin' me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walkin', beggin', I ainâ€™t lovin' you
Don't you get in my way
