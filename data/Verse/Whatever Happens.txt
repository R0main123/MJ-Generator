"Everything will be alright", he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid what they've been doing's not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever

He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, "It's you that makes me happy"
Whatever, whatever, whatever
