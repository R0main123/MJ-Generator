He wear no shoeshine
He's got toe jam football
He's got monkey finger
He shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me"
"One thing I can tell you is you got to be free"

He bag production
He's got walrus gumbo
He's got Ono sideboard
He one spinal clacker
He's got feet down through his knees
Hold you in his arm till you can feel his disease

He roller coaster
He's got early warning
He's got muddy water
He one mojo filter
He say "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see
