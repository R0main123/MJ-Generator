I'm born to lose, you know it's true
And here I stand (Ooh-ooh), I'm losin' you
I am a loser, I am a loser
You are the one to let me know
You needed me, now I have to go
I am a loser (Alright), I am a loser

I am a fool, you know it's true
I believed in you (Ooh-ooh), now you don't even try
I am a loser (Alri-), I am a loser (Wh-what?)
What foolish kind of guy am I?
You break my heart, I wonder why
I am a loser (Alright), I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, alright)
