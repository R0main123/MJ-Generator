Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold?
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is takin' a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me, where were you
When your children cried last night?

Faces fill with madness, oh
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth
