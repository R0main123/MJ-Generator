Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad

In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang, bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

Beat me, hate me, you can never break me

Kick me, **** me, don't you, "Black or white" me

Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black man, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation (Hoo-hoo)
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food (Hoo-hoo)
Kick me, **** me, don't you wrong or right me (We're deep in fire)
