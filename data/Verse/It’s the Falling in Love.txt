You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time, I'm trying not to go too far, 'cause

And though I'm tryin' not to look in your eyes
Each time I do, they kind of burn right through me
Don't wanna lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet, my heart is sayin', "Come and do me"
