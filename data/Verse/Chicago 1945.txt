It was Chicago 1945
Cubs lost that year, but Al Capone was found alive
They searched forty days, in the suburbs of the night
But they found him, alive
Alive
Young Joe DiMaggio hit his first home run
People gathered 'round, basking in the sun
Three girls disappeared, on a cold windy night

It was so windy, joy had to be in the air (Hee hee)
People gather ‘round to see the world's fair
It was so happy, but sad in the truth
So much is goin’ on
They didn’t know the girls were missing, missing
You can’t choose what they say, and nobody can (Hee hee)
Because on the of the Chicago Tribune, feature the world's fair
Girl, didn't bother, you know it is the truth (Hoo hoo)

It was Chicago 1945, Cubs lost that year
But Al Capone was found alive
Searched forty days, in the suburbs of the night
So much was goin’ on
They didn’t know the girls were missing, missing
Can’t choose what they say, nobody can
'Cause on the cover of the Chicago Tribune
Feature the world’s fair (Hoo hoo)
They didn't bother, though it is the scene
