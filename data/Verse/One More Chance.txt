This time going to do my best to make it right
Can't go on without you by my side, hold on
Shelter, come and rescue me out of this storm
And out of this cold, I need someone
Oh, why oh, why, why, why...
(If you see her)
Tell her this for me
All I need is...

Searching for that one who's going to make me whole
Help me make these mysteries unfold, hold on
Lightning about to strike and rain only on me
Hurt so bad, sometimes, it's hard to breathe
Oh, why, why
(If you see her)
Tell her this from me
All I need is...
