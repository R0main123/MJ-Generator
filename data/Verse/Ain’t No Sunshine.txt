Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime she goes away) Mmm

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Only darkness every day
(Only darkness every day)
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime she goes away)
