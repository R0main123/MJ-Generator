I won't give you reason to change your mind
(I can't sit still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
You are all the future that I desire
Girl, I need to hold you
Share my feelings in the heat of love's embrace
Show you all the passion burnin' in my heart today
It's never gonna fade

There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
This will be a love lasting for all time
Girl, you got to hold me
We can touch the sky and light the darkest day
Hold me, only you and I can make sweet love this way
There's no more I can say
