There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, I don't understand it!

There's a thumping in the floor

There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, don't understand it!
