Every day, create your history
Every path you take, you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Every day, create your history
Every path you take, you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

Every hero dreams of chivalry ("I have a dream")
Every child should sing together in harmony
