A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh, the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh, the blood in her hair

But only the man from next door
Knew little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh, the blood in her hair

Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh, it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair
