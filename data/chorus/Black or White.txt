Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, ooh

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right, hee
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, hoo

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye (Hee-hee)
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
