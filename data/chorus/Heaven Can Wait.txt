No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this Earth
I would tell them, "Bring me back to her"
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait

No (Yeah), I don't wanna leave my baby alone (My baby)
I don't want nobody else to hold you (Don't you do this to me)
That's a chance I'll take (If the angels come around, just tell 'em to bring me down to my baby)
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this Earth (Don't you do this to me)
I would tell 'em, "Bring me back to her" (Heaven can wait)
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait
