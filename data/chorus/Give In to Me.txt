Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Talk to me, woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me, give in to me, give in to me
Oh, love is a feeling
I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire
Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me, give in to me
