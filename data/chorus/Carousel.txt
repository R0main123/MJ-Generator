I lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who ran away (Ooh)

I lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart on the carousel (Ooh)
To a circus girl who ran away

I lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart on the carousel
To a circus girl who ran away (I lost my heart)
I lost my heart (I lost) on the carousel (I lost my girl)
To a circus girl who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart (Lost my heart) on the carousel (Lost my girl)
To a circus girl who ran away
