I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
'Cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (You give me)
Ah, 'cause you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I

I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Girl, you give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I (I just wanna touch you)
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna, be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Talk to me, baby) (Inside)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna touch you)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Butterflies)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss (I wanna, I wanna, be with you, girl)
And I wish that I could be with you tonight (Wanna be with you) (You give me)
Ah, you give me butterflies
Inside, inside and I
