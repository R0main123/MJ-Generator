Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am far away and nothing is for real

Speechless (Speechless), speechless (Speechless)
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you (Ooh)
I am far away and nothing is for real

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you
I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel (You're always in my heart)
Though I'm with you
I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless
