And I can’t give you promises
And we can wish upon a star
But I can’t break these promises
But I’ll give you all thе love that I can give
And things in dreams and what is rеal
Like sharing truths and tales of youth and love

And I can’t give you promises
And we can wish upon a star
But I can’t break these promises
But I’ll give you all the love that I can give
And things in dreams and what is real
And sharing truths and tales of youth and love (Aah-aah, aah)
And love (Aah-aah, aah)

No, I can't give you everything
And we can wish upon a star
And I can't break these promises
But I’ll give you all the love that I can give
And things in dreams and what is real
And sharing truth and tales of youth
And all the love that I can give
And things and dreams and what is real
And sharing truth and tales of youth
And..
