(She's got the look) She's got the look, I
Want to know better
(She's got the look) She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look, I
Want to know better
(She's got the look) She's got the look
She's driving me wild

(She's got the look) She's got the look, I
Want to know better
(She's got the look) She's got the look
She's driving me wild
(That look, my baby) She's got the look, I
Want to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's got the look (Hoo!)
She's got the look
(She's got the look) She's got the look, I
I want to know better
(She's got the look) She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look, I
Want to know better
She's got the look
And she's driving me wild
She's got the look, I
Want to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look, I
Want to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look, I
Want to know better
She's got the look
And she's driving me wild
