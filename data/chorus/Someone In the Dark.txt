When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you, never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart, you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars, I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark was you

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky

When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
