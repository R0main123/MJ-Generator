People all over the world
People from country to country
One and the same in the world
And one song we sing
Life should be harmony
In this world of self-destruction
Nations lift your voices and sing

People all over the world

And one song we sing
Life should be harmony
In this world of self-destruction
Nations lift your voices and sing
