Just get your weight off of me
Why don't you just let me be (Hee-hee)
You keep on hating on me (Mercy!)
You just don't have what it takes (Too much for me)
So let me go for our sake (It's too much for me)
No more of me left to break (Listen!)

Just get your weight off of me (Hee-hee)
Why don't you just let me be (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
You keep on hatin' on me (You keep on messin' with me, baby)
You just don't have what it takes (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
So let me go for our sake (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
No more of me left to break (Why don't you just let me go?) (You just, you just put it on me, baby)
Just get your weight off of me (Just do it, baby)
Why don't you just let me be (Why don't ya, baby?) (C'mon!)
You keep on hatin' on me (I'm not satisfied) (Why don't ya, baby?)
You just don't have what it takes (No, no, my baby)
So let me go for our sake (Hoo-hoo-hoo) (Oh no)
No more of me left to break (Hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Hoo-hoo) (Aouw!)

Just get your weight off of me (Yeah)
Why don't you just let me be (Yeah)
You keep on hatin' on me (Hee) (You should just stop your messin', baby!)
You just don't have what it takes (Hee-hee)
So let me go for our sake (Just don't ya, baby?)
No more of me left to break (You just, you just put it)
Just get your weight off of me (Don't do it, baby)
Why don't you just let me be (Why don't ya, baby?)
You keep on hatin' on me (Hatin' me, baby)
You just don't have what it takes (Oh Lord, why?)
So let me go for our sake (Oh lord, oh)
No more of me left to break (Mercy)
(Hoo-hoo)
