Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world
You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (Twinkle at night)
You are the moon (You are the moon)
That glows in my heart (Glows in my heart)
You're my daytime, my nighttime, my world

You are the sun (You are the sun)
You make me shine (You make me shine)
Or more like the stars
