So let me keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
Just come into my arms
While the world goes spinning by
In the glow of candlelight
I will show you're the lady in my life

So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel alright
And, baby, through the years
Gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
That you will always be the lady in my life

And I will keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And, baby, through the years
Even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life
