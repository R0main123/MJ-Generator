Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand-new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling, that's the day
You know I got the hots tonight

Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand-new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling, that's the day
You know I got the hots tonight

Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand-new feeling
Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way (The magic's on its way)
Girl, if we try (Take your time), we can set all our senses reeling, that's the day
You know I got the hots tonight, girl, girl, girl
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand-new feeling
(Girl, yeah)
Just take your time (Take your time) and you'll see that the magic's on its way (Take your time, girl, hey)
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling (We can try, we can try), that's the day
You know I got the hots tonight
Our love will shine at the dawn of a brand-new feeling (No other, no other)
Just take your time (Take your time) and you'll see that the magic's on its way (Take your time)
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling (Time), that's the day
