So baby, be mine (Baby, you gotta be mine), ooh
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time), ooh
And we can share this ecstasy
As long as we believe in love

So baby, be mine (Baby, you gotta be mine), ooh
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time), ooh
You're everything this world could be
The reason that I live, oh

So baby, be mine (Baby, you gotta be mine)
(Tell me that you love me all the time)
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give (Say you're thinking of me)
So baby, be mine (Girl, be mine, all the time)
(Show me how it should be, hold me tight)
You're everything this world could be (Every night)
The reason that I live (It's alright, every night)
