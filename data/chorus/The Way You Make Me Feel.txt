The way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet (You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (My lonely days are gone)
Uh, uh

The way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet now, baby (You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (My lonely days are gone)

The way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet now, baby, hee (You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone, ah, ah (My lonely days are gone)
The way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet now, baby, hee (You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (My lonely days are gone)
