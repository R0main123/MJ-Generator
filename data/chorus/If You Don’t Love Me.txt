And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
What will I do girl?
'Cause I'm in love with you

And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
'Cause I'm in love with you
You!
