(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Doing it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing
(Speed demon)
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Doing it on the highway, gotta have it my way
(Speed demon)
Mind is like a compass, I'm stopping at nothing
(Speed demon)
Just pull over, boy, and get your ticket right

(Speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway, gotta get a leadway
(Speed demon)
Got fire in my pocket like I just lit a rocket
(Speed demon)
Just pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
Ah, pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
Just pull over, boy, and eat your ticket
Pull over, boy, pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
