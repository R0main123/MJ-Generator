She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time

I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine
