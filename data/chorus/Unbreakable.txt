You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me (You can't break me), 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it (I'm unbreakable), you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me (You can't touch me), 'cause I'm untouchable (Why do you do it, baby?)
And I know you hate it (Come on, now), and you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me—
You can't stand it because I'm unbreakable

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (Yeah)
And you can't touch me, ah (I'm untouchable), 'cause I'm untouchable ('Cause I'm untouchable)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (Yeah)
You'll never break me (Yeah), 'cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (You, you, you, you, you)
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it (You hate it), and you can't take it (Ooh)
You'll never break me (I'm unbreakable), 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it, (Hoo, hoo, hoo), you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me (Yeah, ah), 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it (Why did you do it?), and you can't take it (Just why did you do it?)
You'll never break me—
You can't touch me, you can't break me
You can't stand it because I'm unbreakable
