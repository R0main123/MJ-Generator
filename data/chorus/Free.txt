Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine

Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine
Babe, alright
Ahh, ahh
Oh, yeah

Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind, babe
(Free like the wind blows)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(Wherever I go)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(And I'll take my time, baby)
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind
(Free like the wind)
To fly away just like a sparrow (Ooh, my, my, mine)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go)
Free, free like the wind blows
(You'll be free, now)
(I want to be free)
To fly away just like a sparrow
(I just want to be free)
The feel of letting my hair blow
(I want to be free) (Ah, ah, uh, oh baby)
To take my time wherever I go
(Wherever I go - ooh!)
I've got to be free, free, free, free
[laughs]
Ronnie, you are so silly!
