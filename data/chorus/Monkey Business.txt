Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (Oh yeah)
I caught your mom she doing a dude
You can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you (oh Lord)
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey Business going down

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh lord) (doggone)
I caught your mom she doing a dude
You can't lie 'cause I was looking right at you (oh lord)
Stop it
It is too much
Monkey business going down

Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh lord) (Hoo) (Hoo-hoo)
I caught your mother she doing a dude
You can't like it that we're looking right at you
(You are dirty, you are dirty, dirty, dirty baby)
Your brother's got kids with your mother-in-law
I might drop dead about what I saw (oh Lord) (Hee-hee) (Hoo-hoo)
Your brother didn't make it out the two times two
You sitting 'round here telling how he did it to you
Stop it
It's too much
Monkey business going down
