I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around
When things would hurt you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free
When living seemed so hard to be
And things would hurt ya?
I am forever

Wasn't it I who said that you arе free
When living seemed so hard to be
And things would hurt you?
I am forеver
I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around
When things would hurt you
I am forever

I am forever

I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around
When things would hurt you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free
When living seemed so hard to be
And things would hurt you?
We are forever
