You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should feel threatened by me

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened by me

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened (No, no, baby)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened

You should be watchin' me
You should feel threatened (No, no, know it)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Yeah)
Every time your lady speaks
She speaks to me, threatened (She speaks to me)
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should feel threatened (And you, threatened by me, hoo-hoo!)
You should be watchin' me (Come on, baby)
You should feel threatened (Yeah)
While you sleep, while you creep
You should be threatened (Hoo-hoo!)
Every time your lady speaks (I ain't threatened)
She speaks to me, threatened (Hoo-hoo, I ain't threatened)
Half of me, you'll never be
So you should be threatened by me
