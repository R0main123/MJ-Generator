Because this is Hot Street (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street, yeah (Ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street (Ooh!)

'Cause this is Hot Street, ooh! (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
Yeah, this is Hot Street, no (Ready or not)
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street (Ooh!)

'Cause this is Hot Street (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street, oh (Ready or not)
And the fantasy will never stop
'Cause this is Hot Street (Burning It Up)
Just feel the night beat, yeah (Fun on the run)
'Cause this is Hot Street (Ready or not)
And the fantasy will never stop
