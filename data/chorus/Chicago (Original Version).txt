She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (She was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (She was lovin' me)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah

She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (She's lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone (Look who's lovin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave (Holdin' her to blame)
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah (Holdin' her to blame)
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me but she was still your wife (Holdin' her to blame)
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeah
