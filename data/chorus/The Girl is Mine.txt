[Interlude: Paul & Michael]
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?
Ha, ha, Paul, I think I told you I'm a lover, not a fighter
Eh, I've heard it all before, Michael
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yeah, she said it; you keep dreaming
