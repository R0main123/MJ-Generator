Susie got your number, and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie got your number and Susie says it right

Susie got your number, and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie got your number, you know Susie says it right (Hoo-hoo!)
Susie got your number, Susie ain’t your friend
(Ah, it's goin' down, baby)
Look who took you under with seven inches in (She's stuck seven inches in)
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife (It's goin' down, baby, ah)
Susie got your number, and Susie says it's right
