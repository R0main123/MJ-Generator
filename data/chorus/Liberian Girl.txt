Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says, "Do you love me?"
And he says, "So endlessly
I love you, Liberian girl"

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
Just like in the movies
With two lovers in a scene
And she says, "Do you love me?"
And he says, "So endlessly
I love you, Liberian girl"

Liberian girl
You know that you came and you changed my world
I wait for the day
When you have to say, "I do"
And I'll smile and say it too
And forever will be true
