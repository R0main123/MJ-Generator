All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us

All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
We're deep in the fire (Hoo-hoo)
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us
I'm here to remind you (Hoo-hoo)
All I wanna say is that
They don't really care about us (Hee)
Don't you sit back and watch the beatin'
