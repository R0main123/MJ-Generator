Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?

Do you remember the time (Do you remember?)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time? (Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time ('Cause I remember)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time? (All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time (Oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time? (Remember, my baby)
