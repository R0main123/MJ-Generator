I never woulda thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me
I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man
Swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that I'm holdin' her to blame
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so," "I'll never let you go"
Told me that you're doing wrong
Word out shocking all along
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwing rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done nothin' for me
You are disgusting me
(Yeah, yeah)
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad
Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from another hole
Tell her what somebody told
What do you want from me
What do you want from me
Tired of you hunting me
(Yeah, yeah)
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad
Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ's on my team, theme
Reality brings forth realism
It's the man of steel, organism, T.W.I.S.M
I'm full of trisim, take charge like manila
9-5 Shaq represent with the thriller
Grab my crotch, twist my knees, and I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad, who are you?
I don't care what you talkin' 'bout, baby
I don't care what you say
Don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama
I don't care anyway
Time after time, I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb, baby
All is goin' my way
There was a time I used to say "Girl, I need you"
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now, who is sorry now?
You got a way of makin' me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walkin', beggin', I ain’t lovin' you
Don't you get in my way
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk, the way I talk
I cannot explain
The things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
So stay with me, fulfill my dreams
I'll be all you'll need
In time, I knew that love would bring
Such happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I've waited patiently
And girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do
She gave up her life (Ooh) to follow her dreams (Chance again, babe)
Left behind everything for the movie scene
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad (Woo!)
Now that she got her dream, she became a star
It all looked so good, but only good from afar
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could
Now it's back to reality for Ms. Hollywood (Woo!)
(She is) A streetwalker when there is time to spare
She got that big spenders holding their share
A heart of gold, but no one cares (No one seems to care)
Within their eyes
Some young lovers are laughing loud
And there are some old suckers trying to get down
The evening spins around and round (Spins around and round)
Yes, people of the night smoking through the dark
Some feeling you cannot explain
It is such a hard feeling lying in bed's flame
The evening starts to fall again (Starts to fall again)
It is time to come alive
So why not take a chance?
So do surrender 'cause the power is deep inside my soul
Ah, sing it
Promise me, we'll always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me
Though you are gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I will remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tears
Bass note, treble, stereo control, how low you go
Give you just enough to make your juices flow
Press play, don’t stop, rotate, too hot
You feel I’m real
I’m everything you need, so tell me what’s the deal
3D, high speed, feedback, Dolby
Release two or three, when I reach, I can go ‘til I hit my peak
Compact steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady
Shorty really wanna be there for me
Ooh, my honey
You got me workin' day and night
Ooh, my sugar
You got me workin' day and night
Scratch my shoulder
It's achin', make it feel alright
When this is over
Lovin' you will be so right
I often wonder
If lovin' you will be tonight
But what is love, girl
If I'm always out of sight (Ooh!)
You say that workin'
Is what a man's supposed to do
And I say it ain't right
If I can't give sweet love to you (Yeah)
(Ah)
I'm tired of thinkin'
Of what my life's supposed to be
Well, soon enough, darlin'
This love will be reality (Ah, ah)
How can you live, girl
'Cause love for us was meant to be
Well, then you must be seein'
Some other guy instead of me (Ooh!)
You say that workin'
Is what a man's supposed to do
And I say it ain't right
If I can't give sweet love to you
How can you live, girl
'Cause love for us was meant to be
Well, then you must be seein' (Woo!)
Some other guy instead of me (Ooh!)
I'm so undemanding
'Cause they say love is blind
I've lived this life pretending
I can bear this hurt deep inside
I've lived my life the lonely
A soul that cries of shame
With handicapped emotions
Save me now from what still remains
So I've got to be there (Got to be there)
Got to be there in the morning
And welcome her into my world
And show her that she's my girl
When she says, "Hello, world!"
(Got to be there)
I need her sharing the world beside me
That's why I've got to be there (Got to be there)
Got to be there where love begins
And that's everywhere she goes
I've got to be there so she knows
That when she's with me
She's home (Home, she's home)
(Home, she's home) Yeah
Sister confused, she went along
What about love?
What about all I saw?
Biding her time, breathing the words
Singing a song, reciting a Bible verse
Father's confused, mother despair
Brother's in curse
What about all I've seen?
You know the line, you came alone
What about heart?
That’s all I've known
Look at my words
What do they say?
Look in my heart
Burning is all heartbreak
What do you get?
What do you say?
What about love?
I feel my sin
Sister don't know, where will she go?
What about love?
What about all I saw?
What will you care?
Don't be so confused
Love all the things
It's just the things I do
This life don't last forever (Hold my hand)
So tell me what we're waitin' for? (Hold my hand)
We're better off bein' together (Hold my hand)
Than being miserable alone (Hold my hand)
The nights are getting darker (Hold my hand)
For, and there's no peace inside (Hold my hand, oh yeah)
So why make our lives harder (Hold my hand) Yeah, by fighting love tonight? (So, be there, baby)
What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace that you pledge your only son?
What about wising dreams?
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams that you said was yours and mine?
Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The system's in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away, so I can free my mind
Escape is what I need, away from electric eyes
I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change
Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all
Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied
And it shows the second we will call
You know I work too hard for this kind of play (Ho!)
I wrote a letter for the ghetto of the CIA (Ho!)
I don't care a jack bone about what cha' do (Ho!)
Just put your dime on the line, 'cause I own you (Ho!)
Now you better go and get yourself some attitude (Ho!)
I know your name and the game ends in I.O.U (Ho!)
You're telling me that you're coming to a compromise (Ho!)
You're smiling at me while you're stealing right before my eyes (Doggone it; Ho!)
I don't care a jack bone about what cha' do (Ho!)
Just sign your name on the line, baby, I own you (Doggone it)
(Ho!)
(You are a…)
There's a chance for dancin'
All night long
There's a chance for groovin'
And it will be soothin'
With a song
No need for rejection
Determined to be
Gonna groove, gonna move you
Gonna say things to you
Just wait and see
At night (At night)
I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you (Finding you)
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love, love (Hoo!)
I watched you on the floor, cheek-to-cheek
She's getting to you
You didn't see her eyes on me, no
She looked right through you
(Before you make) Before you make
(A big mistake) Remember
That looks can fool you, babe, hee
There's something I would sure appreciate
(If you can keep a secret)
You better take advice, never trust first impressions
I tried to hide this affair from their suspicions
So even if she's asking you to stay
You better know where you stand
It would not be long till we make vows, I bet you
Ooh
I thank the Heavens above that I met you
Ooh
The world is a better place because you came in time
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine
I was afraid because I was hurt the last time
Ooh
I wish you love and goodwill
I wish you praise and joy
I wish you better than your heart desires
And your first kiss from a boy
I'm in love with a beautiful girl
I'm in love with a beautiful girl
He wanna do somethin' freaky to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around ya, girl
He wanna shake it up, shake it down, doin' it right
He wanna jump back, half flap, doin' it right
He wanna lay you down, turn it up, shakin' it loose
He wanna fly high, nigh high, baby, for you'se
He wanna motormouth, float around, baby, the back
He wanna shake it up, shake it down, movin' 'round, haha
He wanna do somethin' freaky to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around ya, girl (Oh)
He wanna glue it up, keep it high, deep in the night
He wanna eyeball, get hard, playin' it right
He wanna turn the key, work the sheets, move to the left
He wanna hot scrub, hot love, makin' it wet
He wanna give hot, jump shot, move to the left
He wanna time bar, slam dunk, hahaha
I don't want to move when I'm in her hands
There's nothing I can do or say, ah
Put everything on hold, cancel all my plans
Tell everybody I'm away, hey
Da, I never know what's running through her mind
No telling what she's going to do, eeh
Her every move is like a danger sign
Daring me to come on through, ayy
She may be bad, but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she wants
Why did you let him get away?
After the staring, what did you say?
Treatin' me bold and cold as ice
Screamed in my face then pulled your knife
She should have spied down his skin
Now, it's my job to get revenge
Why did you let him get away?
Why did you let him get away?
I'm headed for the border, it's on my mind
And nothing really matters, I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror, is he hot on my tracks?
Is he getting nearer? I feel some heat is on my back
Ain't nothing gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speeding on the midway
I gotta really burn this road
You can't win, the world keeps moving
And you're standing far behind
People keep saying, things will get better
(Just to ease your state of mind)
(So you lean back)(And you smoke that smoke)
(And you drink your glass of wine)
You can't win, you can't break even
Ain’t the way it's supposed to be
(You'll be spending) No, no, oh
(Your little bit of money)
While someone else rides for free
(Learn your lesson) Hoo-hoo!
(Refuel your mind before some turkey blows out your flame)
Liberian girl, you came and you changed my world
A love so brand new
Liberian girl, you came and you changed me, girl
A feeling so true
Liberian girl, more precious than any pearl
Your love's so complete
Liberian girl, you kiss me, then, ooh, the world
You do this to me
I won't give you reason to change your mind
(I can't sit still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
You are all the future that I desire
Girl, I need to hold you
Share my feelings in the heat of love's embrace
Show you all the passion burnin' in my heart today
It's never gonna fade
There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
This will be a love lasting for all time
Girl, you got to hold me
We can touch the sky and light the darkest day
Hold me, only you and I can make sweet love this way
There's no more I can say
I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me
Feels like a fire that burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around for every day to start
I haven't left you alone
Something about you, the stare in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away is killing me inside
I need your love in my life
Fought in a battle where nobody won
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You can't run away, the past is said and done
I need us to carry on, oh-oh-oh
Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes, you've got me nervous yet
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise
There's imagination I bet you've never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream about those things you never known?
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find a love so true (Mmm)
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel (Ah), I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do" (I do)
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't worth living if I can't be with you
I've been to Naples, and I
I've been to Georgia, and I
Da-ni-na, da-nan-da, di-de-da
I've been to Estonia, and I
I've been to the ocean, and I
Da-nan-na, da-nan-na, di-de-da
Ah, tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
The lies are disgustin'
So what does it mean? Damn it
Kickin' me down
I got to get up, ah
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it
Hee, hoo-hoo (*screams*)
Peek in the shadow (Hoo-hoo!)
I come into the light (Hee-hee!)
If you tell me I'm wrong (Hee-hee!)
Then you better prove you're right
And you're sellin' out souls
But I, I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight
Our love's an ocean
Give me a notion 'cause
You know I'll never part
Our love goodbye
Our love a season
Give me a reason 'cause
You know I'll never part
Our love goodbye
And together, we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
No place too far for us
We don't need it
Our love’s an ocean
Give me a notion ’cause
You know I'll never see
A thing to see
I love a reason
Give me the truesome ‘cause
You know I'll never part
Our love's a goodbye
And together, we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
(Give you my heart)
No place too far for us
We don't need it
Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things?
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's runnin' it
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killin' me
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page
Livin' encased like animals and cannibals
Eatin' each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
Peace of mind's so hard to find
Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're livin'
The clock is tickin', the end is comin', there'll be no warnin'
But we live to see the dawn
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespectin' each other
Whatever happened to protectin' each other?
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted
Family values are contradicted, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
The pressure is buildin' and I've had enough
Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn
You're beautiful, you're wonderful, incredible, I love you so
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you, girl, it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do if I can't be with you
The world could not go on, so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be?
If the angels came for me, I'd tell them, "No"
Unthinkable
Me sittin' up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be movin' on (Movin' on)
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissin', touchin' her
Couldn't take nobody lovin' you the way we were
What good would Heaven be?
If the angels come for me, I'd tell them, "No"
I am your friend through thick and thin
We need each other, we'll never part
Our love is from the heart
We never say, "I don't need you"
We are forever
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime she goes away) Mmm
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
(Ain't no sunshine when she's gone)
Only darkness every day
(Only darkness every day)
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
(Anytime she goes away)
I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now, I wonder why
I break down when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie?
Is it just a lie
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true
Make a dream come true
I tried to mastermind it
By saying let you be
But everytime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still, you said goodbye
Still, you said goodbye
Look to Heaven
An Angel appears
To love and protect us
Through all of our tears
And the gateway to peace
It stands open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain the things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need
H to the izzo
Make ya leave your Jerky Boy like Frank Rizzo
My neck and back
Jigga voice his music, forget the track
Clap, clap, clap, clap
Before we lose it, Trackmasters bring it back, let's go
In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is fully complete
Our love is true because of you
You're doin' what you do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for allmy life
(Searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find
(Whoa...oh...oh...)
Such a perfect love that's so right (Whoa, girl)
(Ooh-ooh) And when you think of trust, does it lead you home (Oh, ah-ah)
To a place that you only dream of when you're all alone?
(Ooh-ooh) And you can go by the feel 'stead of circumstance
But the power's in believin', so give yourself a chance
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
All you got to do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my call
When I'm tryna get through
Keep me wonderin' why when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you
All I got to say is that I must be dreamin', it can't be real
You're not here with me
See, but I can feel you near to me, yeah
I caress you, let you taste a just so blissful listen
I would give you anything, baby
Just make my dreams come true
Oh, baby, you give me butterflies
You know I can't get away from you, girl
(You've got me shakin')
I need all of the things you do, girl
(My body's aching)
Come on, baby, get up and rock it to the rhythm
Put out your heart to me
And lady, let me set you free
I got a heart beating just for you, girl
(You've got me shakin')
I've tried all, but I can't get you, girl
(My body's aching)
Come on, baby, get up and rock it to the rhythm
(Rock it, baby, hoo!)
Put out your heart to me
And lady, let me set you free (Let me set you free, girl)
Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart, then ask
Have you seen my childhood?
Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had
Heard you woe a loser
But it seems you that don't know the things I know
And if you are believing don't repent that you will
Know where I go
I heard you woe a loser
But don't say that you must get all the time (Hurt so many times)
And don't be just pretending that it's all knowing
Love is here inside
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry 'cause I'm coming (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Back to where I should have always stayed (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
And now, I've learned the meaning to your story (Ooh-ooh)
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Well, it's not my thing trying to get back
But this time, let me tell you where I'm at
Please don't close the door to our future (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
There's so many things we haven't tried (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I will love you better than I used to (Ooh-ooh)
And give you all the love I have inside
(Ah) What you gonna do?
'Cause I'm gonna get you
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
All the things you said
And the things you've done to me
You can no longer make me cry
You tricked me nine-to-five
Lovin' you's a crime
People tellin' me that you got another guy
I've been abused
Watch me light the fuse
Said you'd be my wife, nothin' but big lies
Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee
Every little bird in the tall oak tree
The wise old owl, the big black crow
Flappin' their wings singin', "Go, bird, go"
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
They started goin' steady and a-bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Taught him how to do the bop and it was grand
Started goin' steady and a-bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole
You see yourself in the mirror, ah
And you don't like what you see, ooh
And things aren't gettin' much clearer
Don't you think it's time you go for a change? Oh
Don't waste your time on the past, no, no
It's time you look to the future, oh
It's all right there if you ask
This time, if you try much harder
You will be the best that you can be, oh
If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But, girl, you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you, but still, you say it ain't cool
Now, many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me, how does it seem that you ain't checking for me?
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream
Yo, mami, stop the frontin', I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
The chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, you'll have jetlag and still be fine (Come on now)
He can trip, but this money ain't long enough (Uh-huh)
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough (Uh-huh)
Now, the way you resisting, this ain't cool (For real)
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible (Yeah, yeah)
Come to the place, shocktacy
And you know damn well you know what I mean
Hot in the face, one to three
Like a pleasure trip like you've never seen
Uh-huh!
Satin lace and a paisley cut top
The girl is wasting over
'Cause she knows she looks hot
She's got position, she's got just what it takes
Got a mojo in her pocket
Got it ready just in case
Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold?
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?
People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is takin' a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me, where were you
When your children cried last night?
Faces fill with madness, oh
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth
Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go
Now I'm just wondering why you think
That you can get to me with anything?
Seems like you'd know, by now, when and how I get down
And with all that I've been through, I'm still around
Now, you can't stop me, even though you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughing, ha, while surfacing
A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly .9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you in
Crack baggin', sick of braggin' how my mink be draggin'
Desert E's, street sweepers inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messing with the devil, what?
Et dans cet univers, sans toi c'est un enfer, ne t'en vas pas
Et pouvoir t'embrasser, j'en tremble rien que d'y penser, tout te donner
Les femmes d'avant toi, ne comptent même pas, j'ai oublié tout ton passé (Passé)
La terre peut trembler, la guerre éclater
Je supporterai tout, écoute-moi mon amour
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" (Hee-hee!)
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)
I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said "You know my name"
(She called me!)
"And don't you pretend you never did me before"
(Don't you, don't you, do it!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't you) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)
Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me, baby, and tell me twice
That you're the one for me
I like this feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I've never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me
I'm born to lose, you know it's true
And here I stand (Ooh-ooh), I'm losin' you
I am a loser, I am a loser
You are the one to let me know
You needed me, now I have to go
I am a loser (Alright), I am a loser
I am a fool, you know it's true
I believed in you (Ooh-ooh), now you don't even try
I am a loser (Alri-), I am a loser (Wh-what?)
What foolish kind of guy am I?
You break my heart, I wonder why
I am a loser (Alright), I am a loser (Ooh-ooh, alright)
He wear no shoeshine
He's got toe jam football
He's got monkey finger
He shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me"
"One thing I can tell you is you got to be free"
He bag production
He's got walrus gumbo
He's got Ono sideboard
He one spinal clacker
He's got feet down through his knees
Hold you in his arm till you can feel his disease
He roller coaster
He's got early warning
He's got muddy water
He one mojo filter
He say "One and one and one is three"
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see
This time going to do my best to make it right
Can't go on without you by my side, hold on
Shelter, come and rescue me out of this storm
And out of this cold, I need someone
Oh, why oh, why, why, why...
(If you see her)
Tell her this for me
All I need is...
Searching for that one who's going to make me whole
Help me make these mysteries unfold, hold on
Lightning about to strike and rain only on me
Hurt so bad, sometimes, it's hard to breathe
Oh, why, why
(If you see her)
Tell her this from me
All I need is...
Only know wherever I go
We're as close as two friends can be
There have been others
But never two lovers
Like music, music and me
Grab a song and come along
You can sing your melody
In your mind, you will find
A world of sweet harmony
Birds of a feather, we'll fly together
Now, music, music and me
Music and me
It was Chicago 1945
Cubs lost that year, but Al Capone was found alive
They searched forty days, in the suburbs of the night
But they found him, alive
Alive
Young Joe DiMaggio hit his first home run
People gathered 'round, basking in the sun
Three girls disappeared, on a cold windy night
It was so windy, joy had to be in the air (Hee hee)
People gather ‘round to see the world's fair
It was so happy, but sad in the truth
So much is goin’ on
They didn’t know the girls were missing, missing
You can’t choose what they say, and nobody can (Hee hee)
Because on the of the Chicago Tribune, feature the world's fair
Girl, didn't bother, you know it is the truth (Hoo hoo)
It was Chicago 1945, Cubs lost that year
But Al Capone was found alive
Searched forty days, in the suburbs of the night
So much was goin’ on
They didn’t know the girls were missing, missing
Can’t choose what they say, nobody can
'Cause on the cover of the Chicago Tribune
Feature the world’s fair (Hoo hoo)
They didn't bother, though it is the scene
There's indication
That someone else is standing on the ground
Across the nation
There's always people trying to pull you down
Now is the time
For us to spend this evening close together
Deep in the night
We're holding on to someone else's dream
Girl, can't you see?
They're out to get you
There ain't no issue acting like a fool
Love can possess you
And make you see that heart is gonna move
High in the night
This magic's gonna keep us close together, yeah
We'll start to fly
'Cause this is the beginning of your life
Baby, tonight
There's indication
That someone else is standing on my ground
Across the nation
There's always people trying to pull you down
Now is the time
For us to spend this evening close together
Deep in the night
We're holding on to someone else's dream
Girl, can't you see?
Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of ya 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you
And the weatherman said, if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feelin' down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years, she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
She's out of my hands
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside!
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life
Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
It's the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next, for you to resurrect?
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
It's the blackmail story in all your glory
In the hood, frame him if you could
Shoot to kill, to blame him if you will
If he dies, sympathize
Such false witnesses, damn self-righteousness
In the black, stab me in the back
In the face, to lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
It's the headline stories of all your glory
You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all gettin' loud
If you take the chance and do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down
Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Wanna see an exhibition (A-hee!)
Better do it now before you get too old
Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl
Girlfriend
I'm gonna show your boyfriend (Yeah)
Show him (Woo-hoo)
The letters I've been savin' (Yeah)
Show him how you feel inside
And how love could not be denied (Oh, no)
Girlfriend
You better tell your boyfriend (Yeah)
Tell him (Woo-hoo)
Exactly what we're doin' (Yeah)
Tell him what he needs to know
Or he may never let you go, yeah
She's just a lover who's doin' me by
It's worth the givin', it's worth the try
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it
She wants to give it
It's just a feelin', you have to soothe it
You can't neglect it, you can't abuse it
It's just desire, you cannot waste it
Then if you want it, then won't you taste it?
She wants to give it
If you can get it, is it worth the try?
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's achin', you have to rub it
She wants to give it
Where did you come from, lady?
And ooh, won't you take me there?
Right away, won't you, baby?
Tenderoni, you've got to be
Spark my nature, sugar, fly with me
Nothin' can stop this burnin' desire to be with you
Gotta get to you, baby
Won't you come? It's emergency
Cool my fire yearnin'
Honey, come set me free
There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, I don't understand it!
There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin in-lay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling, don't understand it!
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
All alone, she's in the ego zone
The word is out that you're doin' wrong
On the move, got fire in your shoes
By word of mouth, you are on the loose
You're livin' on sunset time (You're livin' on sunset time)
(Hoo!)
Feelin' bad, you're livin' much too fast
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
In the raw, they don't know what you saw
From word of mouth, you're breakin' every law
On the go, got fever in your soul
You better not shout where you gonna go
Livin' hot, doin' what you should not
The break's on me then what do you get
We're livin' on sunset time (We're livin' on sunset time)
(Want that dime)
Shoot the breeze, you feel that she's the tease
Your night is free, what you want to be?
Who's to trust when livin' dangerous?
Tonight's your night, but this is what you lose
Goin' town, you do it every time
The word's got out that you're on the line
On the move, got fever in your shoes
The night's on you, what are you gonna do?
A revelation, fulfill the truth
The final message, we'll bring to you
There is no danger, fulfill the truth
So come together, we need you
I was the clown and she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work, but we took our chances
What I can't recall is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember all of those faces
And now, all I have is memories, oh-woah
What have we've done to the world? Look what we've done
What about all the peace that you pledge your only son?
What about flowering fields? Is there a time?
What about all the dreams that you said was yours and mine?
I never would have thought she was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
And when I held her near
She would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me
In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand
Father comes home from work
And he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid, and the note she read
Father runs to the table, he said, "What's goin' on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone"
She wrote that she is tired of stepdaddy using her
Sayin' that he'll buy her things, while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone, somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothin' to eat
Now, she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, the man is waitin' there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl, just let down your hair"
He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hot, girl, that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there, they told
He's arresting this little girl
Who's only twelve years old
Don't walk away
See, I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you’ll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray?
I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long, now, all I do is cry
Can’t we find some love to take this away?
'Cause the pain gets stronger every day
Ah, ah, the word is out, ah
You're doin' it wrong, ah
Gon' lock you up before too long, ah
Your lyin' eyes gon' tell you right, ah
So listen up, ah, don't make a fight, ah
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man, ah
You're throwin' stones to hide your hands
Well Lord have mercy
Well Lord have mercy
Don't be calling out "Mercy me"
Don't be calling down babe
Said lord have mercy
Even worse the birthday
Don't be calling out "Mercy me"
Don't be going down babe
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize your neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
The demons squeal in sheer delight
It's you they spy, so plump, so right
For though the groove is hard to beat
Yet still you stand with frozen feet
You try to run, you try to scream
But no more sun you'll ever see
For evil reaches from the crypt
To crush you in its icy grip
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40,000 years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the Thriller
I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered, "No" to me
Well, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
The day that she'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon, ooh-ooh
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it
Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal hat, the man is Mike, so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first, I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
'Cause it ain't too hard to
Like the loss of sunlight on a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon
Like a castle built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon
Like a perfect flower that is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon
Like a sunset dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon
There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin, it lay open
Where a restless soul is smoking
This time around, I'll never get bit
Though you really wanna fix me, uh (Ah)
This time around, you're makin' me sick
Though you really want to get me (Ah)
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
They really want to fix me, hit me (Uh)
But this time around, I'm takin' no shit
Though you really want to get me
You really want to get me
This time around, I'll never get bit
Oh, you really want to get me (You really want to get me)
But this time around, I'm takin' no shit
Though you really want to fix me (Uh, you really want to fix me)
Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
You really to use me and then falsely accuse me (Accuse me)
This time around, they'll take it like spit
Though you really can't control me (Uh, you really can't control me)
You know you can't control me, ugh
Listen, I got problems of my own (Uh)
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone (Uh-huh)
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missin', maybe it could be (Uh)
My friends, but they ain’t friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me, from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean (Uh-huh)
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin', I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'ma kill a nigga, I ain’t joking, Indo smoke got me chokin' (Uh)
I'm hopin' a fool come slippin', so I can blow him open
This time around, I changed up my flow (Uh-huh)
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by the door (Uh)
A real set of peoples to watch my back (Uh-huh)
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that, baby (This time around, yeah)
You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
You're the one that I adore
Just kiss me once, I wanna know you
Feel the vibe that I can feel in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Yesterday was when I felt down
I start tryin' to make you think that I was around
You know, life was just a thing, she don't pass the way I do
Because I want to be
Yesterday was when I felt down
I start tryin' to make sense like I was around
And was tryin' to make the way to see, what a thing I do
You know 'cause I want to be
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom
So they came in to the out way
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
He's leaving no clues left behind him
And he had no way of knowing
Of the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin
I was alone in the dark when I met you
(Ah-ooh-ooh)
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
(Ah-ooh-ooh)
It won't be long 'til we make vows, I bet you
(Ah-ooh-ooh)
I thank the Heavens above that I met you
(Ah-ooh-ooh)
Here, abandoned in my fame
(Armageddon of the brain)
KGB was doggin' me (Hee)
(Take my name and just let me be)
Then a beggar boy called my name (Hee)
(Happy days will drown the pain)
On and on and on, it came and the rain and again and again
(Take my name and just let me)
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em, "I ain't second to none"
Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from, it's where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life being a color
Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes, I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no
She plays the game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now, she's thinking that I will never know
And she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same
I can't blame her, I thought it was love with this game, huh? (Huh?)
When you dealing with emotions, it's pain ma (Mm-mm) (Yeah, alright)
Take a closer look, you're dealing with a stranger
I can't change her, now (Mm)
The heart burner one place then you'll see (Right)
It won't heal from Pepcid AC (Mm-mm) (Uh-huh)
Ball-hard player, she a star player
I need LensCrafters, I ain't seen the heartbreaker, come on (Take it from me)
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you, I'm in the light where I can not be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called 'Hallowed Ground'
There I am, so all alone
And I'm so sad and lonely
Tell me, what will I do
I can’t reveal, I’m holdin' on
I want you still to love me
I feel I am your fool
They say I'm different, they don't understand
But there's a bigger problem that's much more in demand
You've got world hunger, not enough to eat
So there's really no time to be trippin' on me
You've got school teachers who don't wanna teach
You've got grown people who can't write or read
You got strange diseases, ah, but there's no cure
You got many doctors that aren't so sure
So tell me
We've got more problems than we'll ever need
You got gang violence and bloodshed on the street
You got homeless people with no food to eat
With no clothes on their back and no shoes for their feet
We've got drug addiction in the minds of the weak
We've got so much corruption, police brutality
We've got streetwalkers walking into darkness
Tell me, what are we doing to try to stop this?
If you smile with your fear and sorrow
Smile, and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear
May be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile through your fear and sorrow
Smile, and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name and I'll be there
One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name and I'll be there
You're pretty, baby, are your kisses for your lover?
I really get it when you're next to me, yeah yeah
I'm so excited how you give it all your lovin'
I got it comin' and it's ecstasy
Streetwalkin' baby
'Cause every day, I watch you paint the town so pretty
I see you comin' in and off on my thought, yeah, yeah
You don't believe me then you can ask my brother
'Cause every day at six, home alone
I hear you walkin' 'cause your body's talkin' to me
I chase you every step of the way, yeah, yeah
An invitation to some faraway hot island
If I can show you, baby, home with me
I have to tell you that you give me strong hot fever
My every thought is you and that's a fact, yeah, yeah
I'd like to take you places, how about New York City?
Or Paris, France? What do you think of that?
This is it, here I stand
I'm the light of the world, I feel grand
Got this love, I can feel
And I know, yes, for sure, it is real
This is it, I can say
I'm the light of the world, runaway
We can feel this is real
Every time I'm in love, that, I feel
This is it (This is it), I can feel (I can feel)
I'm the light of the world, this is real
Feel my song, we can say
And I tell you I feel that way
He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say, one day, you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fire's deep in his eyes
Don't let no one get you down
Keep moving on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self-motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history
She was only playin' with this guy
Did you notice this, all gone?
She seemed to be on a mission, bound up in his smile
Did you notice this? Oh, Lord
She was only missin', lovin' this guy
Gonna get through this, oh man (Ooh-ooh)
But she seemed to up and left me, what an awful blow
Can you tell me, which way did she go?
I've lost my baby two years ago
Have you seen her? (Alright, yeah)
Well, she seemed to up and left me
What an awful blow
Can you tell me, which way did she go? (Ooh, girl)
I got to feeling of giving you, I
Won't jump back
She won’t let it
I got a feeling
Like nothing around
And I'm so damn, so damn glad about it
She don't smoke, she don't do weed
She don't hash, she don't dope
But she's a liar
I got a feeling like nothing around
And I'm so damn, so damn glad about it
She's serious
Makin' me delirious, I'm curious
Next thing I know what was hitting us
Enjoying the animal magnetism
She's too hot to touch, too cool for criticism
Each and every things like a mini movie being filmed
'Cause I'm the captain and our body's the helm
I'm shivering, quivering
I smile while I'm delivering
Get some love and passion
It's never been so intense and spiritual like
In sense of above, against and all off in silence
Then I scream like a man out of his wits
'Cause that's how serious her serious effect is
Some of you still wonder why one of my friends had to die
To get a message across, that yet you haven't heard
My friend was chased and confused like many others I knew
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away
She get no second chance, she's ridiculed and harassed
Please tell me why? (Hold on) (Mercy)
Now, there's a lesson to learn, respect's not given, it's earned
Stop maliciously attackin' my integrity
Hot legs all into the room, she's got the
One! (Hot cheaper)
Netted stockings, purple panties that show, she's got
Bad lips, with a ring In her nose, she's got
Busted butts, all into the seat, she's got
I was thinking that she try to be mean
Hot lips all up to her neck, she's got
Funky finger but she's giving him sex, she's got
Bad legs all into the truth, she's got
Such a feeling but she's singing the blues, she's got
Hotfix, meenie minee mo
She doesn't play piano, but she did rock and roll
Hot legs all into the room, she's got
Musty water, hot cheaper perfume, she's got
Netted stockings, purple panties that show, she's got
Bad lips, with a ring in her nose, she's got
Monkey busty all into the seat
She wants to be a movie star, she'd sell on TV
Weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?
But they told me a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight 'til the end, but I'm only human
Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain
Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Neglecting the needs in her prayers
Got a hot foot
Better freak across the floor
Join the party
And we'll keep you movin', that's for sure
Are you ready?
Won't you rock across the room?
Got a feelin'
That we're gonna raise the roof off soon
When you sit there addressing
Counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping
And my heart is weeping
Because I'm keeping a place
I took my baby on a riverboat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited 'bout the way that things could've been
She said that I don't care
I wore a face no one could recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of takin' pictures, autographs, then they grabbed
My joy had turned to pain
I am a cover of a magazine, what a scene
They know my every news
"Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine"
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you want to take a ride, look behind
Someone is followin' you
You try to get away, you turn real fast, but too bad
They know your every move
I'd like to take some time and get away, then they say
"Is that boy still alive?"
The weak, they'd really start to take the pills, what a thrill
Only the strong survive
"Everything will be alright", he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid what they've been doing's not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever
He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, "It's you that makes me happy"
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Lovely is the feeling now
Fever, temperature's rising now
Power (Oh, power) is the force, the vow
That makes it happen
It asks no questions why, ooh
So get closer (Closer now) to my body now
Just love me
'Til ya don't know how, ooh
Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain't nothing like a love desire, ooh
I'm melting (I'm melting) like hot candle wax
Sensation (Ah, sensation)
Lovely where we're at, ooh
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complaining, ooh
'Cause this is love power, ooh
Heartbreak enemy despise
Eternal (Oh, eternal) love shines in my eyes, ooh
So let love take us through the hours (Oh, let love)
I won't be complaining, hoo (No, no)
'Cause your love is alright, alright, ooh
I'm like your dog on a chain
My thoughts of you still remain
You signed the house in your name, listen!
I got the pill you should take
A bad disease I could shake
You're every doctor's mistake, baby! (Yeah)
So you call it trust, but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church, read the holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge, you're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you, my friend, but
Insurance? Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? (Ah) I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your god is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles, the idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
And for this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere just as long as you were there
They wanna get my ass dead or alive
You know he really tried to take me down by surprise
I bet he missioned with the CIA
He don't do half what he say
He out shock in every single way
He stop at nothing just to get his political say
He think he hot 'cause he's BSTA
I bet he never had a social life anyway
You think he brother with the KKK?
I bet his mother never taught him right anyway
He want your vote just to remain TA
He don't do half what he say
Don't need no fortune or fame
I just want you close to me (There's no mystery)
No time for castles in space
Or living in make believe (Don't you just see)
Ooh, I'd trade it all for just a rainy day
As long as I know you'll be there, girl
Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress, oh
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in a beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl
You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time, I'm trying not to go too far, 'cause
And though I'm tryin' not to look in your eyes
Each time I do, they kind of burn right through me
Don't wanna lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet, my heart is sayin', "Come and do me"
I told the doctor that I'm broken-hearted
And my temperature has risen to a hundred and three
Why don't you write me back and save me girl?
Tell me what I wanna hear, like you're missin' me, but
You're fearing me 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watchin' you when you sleep
When you're in bed, I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall
And when you scream, it's 'cause of me
You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere (Everywhere)
In one blink, I'll disappear
And then, I'll come back to haunt you
The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear
He got a place, baby, kicked in the face, baby
He hate your race, baby, you're not the liar
You're every lick, baby, your dog's a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby, you talk survival
She never cut from me, she never fuck, baby
I got to work, baby, you're just a rival
A razor blade, daddy, right up your leg, daddy
You're throwin' shade, daddy, so undesirable
He got shit, baby, your dog's a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby, you are a liar
Is truth a game, daddy? Deep in the fame, baby
You're called a Saint, baby, you're so beloved
Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
Looking out across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang, bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
*** me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, **** me, don't you, "Black or white" me
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black man, blackmail, throw the brother in jail
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation (Hoo-hoo)
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food (Hoo-hoo)
Kick me, **** me, don't you wrong or right me (We're deep in fire)
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)
I am your friend through thick and thin
We need each other, we'll never part
Our love is from the heart
We'll never say, "I don't need you"
We are forever
I am your toy, I am your boy
I am the moonlight, you are the spring
Our lives are sacred things
You know I always will love you, I am forever
I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
And when I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place (Hee-hee-hee)
So take off the mask, so I can see your face
I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
And when I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place (Hee-hee-hee)
So take off the mask, so I can see your face
You'll never make me stay, so take your weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before, but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time, you won't seduce me
She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She said "I have to go home, 'cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone, why don't you come with me?"
I said "My baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright"
Ben, you're always running here and there
(Here and there)
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
(Anywhere)
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
(You've got a place to go)
Ben, most people would turn you away (Turn you away)
I don't listen to a word they say (A word they say)
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothin' he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin'
To keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin' (Hee)
Billie Jean is always talkin' when nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', spyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'
If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
Then don't have a baby (Yeah, yeah)
And don't think maybe (Yeah, yeah)
If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustlin', stealin', lyin'
Now, baby's slowly dyin'
As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
At where kids are playin'
And people are laughin' and smilin' and nothin' to fear
She said, "This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness"
She turned around, looked down in my eyes
And started cryin'
Grab my hand, you've got a friend, oh
We could sail away our dreams to our Never Neverland
We could kiss the world and wish upon a distant star
I could say the future, hope for us has different promises
And the answers lie deep inside your lovely eyes
I could look inside your mind and tell that you’re far away
Don’t say a word, just let me whisper inside your ear
I could see that you are trying hard to be my friend
All the words you wanna say is all I want to hear
Did you ever stop to think just why I look inside your eyes?
‘Cause this love we have is just a dream away
I could tell you’re crying ‘cause you really love me, girl
And the answers lie deep in the words I have to say
I could say the future, hope for us has different promises
And the life we need is just a life away
I could look inside your mind and tell that you love me, girl
And the words you want to hear, is all I wanna say
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (Rrr)
You have to show them that you're really not scared (Ooh)
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare (Ooh)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be out her mind
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance, she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed the pride
She knew she was needed back home, home
I was strong enough to fight
I was never wrong but always right, dah
Bring it on me
I was trying to crack the code
But now I’m gonna lay a revelation
Dah, bring it on me
I was playing the underdog
I got my kicks but I got no home
Bring it on me
Life was sweet and life was bad
Got my time while I'm doin' that
Bring it on me
I was livin' high and low
I got my kicks and I got my soul
Bring it on me
I was doing the underdog
I got my kicks but I got no home
Bring it on me
I was really doing bad
I got my time and I got my past
Dah, bring it on me
I was living in the right
I got my time without a sound
Dah, bring it on me
Love to run my fingers
Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles to your eyes
Like a trip to Heaven
Heaven is the prize
And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise
She got your number, ah, how does it feel, ah
To know this stranger, ah, is about to kill?
Ah, she got your baby, ah, it happened fast, ah
If you could only, ah, erase the past, ah
Baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it was ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Ooh baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Now, I wake up every day
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'Cause you love me
Ooh, hey, my girl
She does something to my chemistry
And when I'm close, I'm sure
I raise her temperature about three degrees
Every day, yeah
In every way, she makes my motor purr
And I reciprocate
My life I dedicate to lovin' her
Understanding
Whenever handing any alibis
Instead of what you do
Where you been or what's the use?
We make it nice (Uh-huh, it's a nice, nice time)
